# Warm up, Relax and Strength Training

The secret to being able to play pickleball for a long time is to warm up well before playing and relax properly after it. At the same time, good physical fitness is a prerequisite for advanced-level competition.

Therefore, both amateurs and professional athletes should pay attention to warm-up, relaxation, and physical training.

## Warm Up

The purpose of a warm-up is to activate the body's joints and associated muscles to avoid injury from sudden stress.

The warmup should be done in the order from the whole to the part, from the large joint to the small joint.

* Activate waist by bending to front, back and side;
* Activate shoulders and arms by moving up, down, and to the side;
* Leg press and leg stretch;
* Activate wrist and ankle joints;
* Jogging and jumping exercises.

## Relax

During intense exercise, muscle tissue undergoes a rapid contraction and relaxation process, which may cause the originally neatly arranged muscle fibers to cross and bend.

The purpose of relaxation is to relax the muscle tissue, bringing its fibers back into alignment.

Relaxation should be done by relaxing the large muscles first, followed by the small muscles.

* Relax waist muscles by keeping to bend to front, back and side for seconds;
* Relax back muscles by stretching;
* Relax leg muscles by crossing and stretching;
* Relax arm muscles by stretching.

Relaxation can be done by stretching, pressing, etc., and can be done with equipment (such as rollers, yoga mats).
