# Warm up, Relax and Strength Training

Sufficient warm-up and reasonable relaxation are the keys to avoid sports injuries and maintain long-term healthy sports. At the same time, sufficient physical fitness is also a prerequisite for high-level competition.

Therefore, both amateurs and professional athletes should pay attention to the importance of warm-up, cool-down and physical training.

## Warm Up

The purpose of warming up is to activate the joints and associated muscles of the body to avoid injury. The joints determine the angle and range of motion, and the muscles protect the joints. Warm up should be carried out in the order from the whole to the local, from the large joints to the small joints.

Here are some common warm-up moves.

* Activate waist by bending to front, back and side;
* Activate shoulders and arms by moving up, down, and to the side;
* Leg press and leg stretch;
* Activate wrist and ankle joints;
* Jogging and jumping exercises.

## Relax

During intense exercise, muscle tissue will contract and relax rapidly, and this process may cause the originally neatly arranged muscle fibers to stagger and bend. If the muscles are in this state for a long time, they are prone to injury. The purpose of relaxation is to maintain muscle performance by relaxing and massaging muscle tissue to restore its fibers to a state of neat alignment.

To achieve effective relaxation, it is important to focus on relaxing the larger muscle groups first, followed by the smaller muscles.

* Relax waist muscles through gentle bending to the front, back, and sides for a few seconds. This helps to release tension in the lower back and hips.;
* Stretch your back muscles by standing up straight and reaching your arms overhead, gently arching your back. This helps to release tension in the upper back and shoulders;
* Relax leg muscles by crossing your legs and gently stretching them by reaching forward towards your toes. This helps to release tension in the hamstrings and calf muscles;
* Stretch your arm muscles by reaching up and overhead, then gently pulling one arm across your chest to stretch the shoulder and upper arm muscles.

Relaxation can also be achieved through techniques such as stretching, self-massage, and pressure point therapy. Equipment such as foam rollers and yoga mats can be useful for enhancing relaxation exercises and providing additional support.
