# How to Volley

The **Volley** is a primary attacking shot in pickleball, often used to finish points, especially in doubles.

## What is a Volley?

A volley is hitting the ball out of the air before it bounces. Volleys reduce the opponent's reaction time and allow you to maintain an offensive position at the net. In professional play, "hands battles" (rapid-fire volley exchanges) often require reaction times of under 0.25 seconds.

Types of volleys based on location:
*   **Backcourt Volley**: Usually a defensive block against a deep, high ball (like a lob or deep drive).
*   **Transition Volley (Mid-court)**: Often a "Reset". As you move from the baseline to the NVZ, you may need to softly block a hard shot into the kitchen to neutralize the point.
*   **Net Volley (NVZ Line)**: The most common type. This can be:
    *   **Punch Volley**: A compact, offensive push deep into the court.
    *   **Dink Volley**: Softly tossing a ball out of the air back into the kitchen.
    *   **Overhead Smash**: Crushing a high ball (lob/pop-up) downward for a winner.

**Important**: You cannot step inside the Non-Volley Zone (Kitchen) while volleying or let your momentum carry you into it after the shot.

## When to Volley

*   **To Attack**: When a ball is high enough (above the net), punch it deep or smash it.
*   **To Press**: Taking the ball out of the air denies the opponent time to recover or get back in position.
*   **To Defend**: Blocking a hard drive at the net requires a volley.

## Mastering the Volley

**Technique**:
1.  **Preparation**: Keep your paddle up ("paddle chest high") and ready.
2.  **Footwork**: Split step as the opponent hits. Stay balanced.
3.  **Motion**:
    *   For a **Punch Volley**: Use a compact, forward motion (like a high-five). Minimal backswing. Keep the wrist firm.
    *   For a **Reset/Block**: Loosen your grip. Absorb the speed of the ball (like catching an egg) and guide it into the kitchen.
    *   For a **Smash**: Turn sideways, reach up, and snap your wrist and arm forward to drive the ball down.

**Placement**:
*   **Deep**: Aim for the opponent's feet near the baseline.
*   **Open Space**: Angle the ball away from the opponent.
*   **The Body**: "Jam" the opponent by aiming at their right hip/shoulder.
*   **The Middle**: In doubles, confusion often occurs down the center line.

**Note**: Avoid aiming too close to the sidelines unless you have a clear opening, as the margin for error is small.

## Defending a Volley

If the opponent is attacking you with volleys:
1.  **Stand Ground or Retreat**: If they are loading up for a smash, take a step back and get low.
2.  **Paddle Ready**: Protect your body.
3.  **Reset**: Don't try to out-hit a smash. Softly block the ball into the kitchen (a reset) to force them to dink, neutralizing their offense.
4.  **Counter-Attack**: If they hit a "lazy" volley (not fast enough), quickly punch it back at them (a "firefight").

## Training Methods

1.  **Wall Volleys**: Stand 4-5 feet from a wall. Volley rapidly against it without letting the ball bounce. Aim for 50 in a row (forehand, backhand, alternating).
2.  **Partner Volleys**: Stand at the NVZ line across from a partner. Volley back and forth, keeping the ball in the air. Start slow for control, then speed up.
3.  **Machine Gun Drill**: Have a partner fire balls at you from the baseline while you stand at the net; practice blocking them safely into the kitchen.
