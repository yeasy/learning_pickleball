# How to Lob

The Lob technique is close to the badminton technique of pushing the ball to the backcourt.

This technology is easily overlooked, but it is very useful in actual combat, which can change pace and create new competition situation.

## What is Lob

Lobing the ball mainly refers to the technique of jumping the ball into the opponent's backcourt. Proper use of the Lob-and-Lob technique can mobilize the opponent's movement, change the rhythm of the game, and create opportunities for offense.

* Far-net Lob: Lobing the ball from the backcourt to the opponent's backcourt;
* Midfield Lob: Lob the ball to the opponent's backfield from the midfield position;
* Near-net Lob: when the opponent's return is high; when the opponent's Dink return is not of high quality,

## When to use Lob

When the opponent's position or attention is in the frontcourt, and the jump or back footwork is not good enough, you can use the Lob-ball technique to force the opponent to hit the ball in the backcourt.

Lobing the ball can save you from passive to proactive, and can also actively create opportunities for potential volleys.

After lobing the ball, move to the net and prepare to attack when the opponent returns the ball too high.

## How to master the Lob

The core point of Lobing the ball is to keep the ball higher than the opponent's position after jump to avoid the opponent volleying in the air. Therefore, the parabolic high point of the Lob ball should be close to the opponent's baseline, so that the ball falls vertically near the baseline and does not go out.

When lobbing the ball, keep in mind:

* Keep a similar action as Dink, to avoid the opponent's prejudgment to volley.
* Control the trajectory's height, let it stay just above the opponent's volley top.
* Control the ball's landing point, let it land as close to the baseline as possible. Usually let it land near opponent's backhand side.

Lobing the ball can be practiced in a number of ways:

* Multi-ball practice: repeatedly Lob the ball to correct the trajectory and landing point;
* Ball feeding practice: The sparring party gives balls in different positions to carry out ball Lobing training.

When the opponent lobs the ball, you should first quickly judge whether you can jump and volley back directly. If not, you should quickly run to the area the ball is flying to. If the ball is landing in the court, wait for the ball to land and bounce and then hit back the ball. Usually use Drop to return the ball in this situation.
