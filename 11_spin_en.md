# Master Spin

Spin is an important charm of ball games. Reasonable use of spin can better control the ball.

## Common types

According to the direction of Spin, it can be divided into the following categories:

* Topspin: The ball rolls forward rapidly, causing the arc to fall sharply, and the ball path is shorter than that of non-spinning balls;
* Backspin: The ball rolls back quickly, resulting in a flatter arc and a longer ball path than a non-spinning ball;
* Sidespin: Including left-spin or right-spin, the ball will deviate in the direction of Spin.

## When to use Spin

Pickleballs spin relatively weakly (generally less than 10 revolutions per second), and because of the smooth surface, spin plays a lesser role.

Consider using Spin in the following scenarios:

* Serve: The opponent's judgment error is caused by topspin or side spin;
* Dink: Causes the opponent to hit the ball poorly by topspin or side spin;
* Drive the ball or return the ball to the backcourt: avoid the ball going too long or out of bounds by topspin;
* Volley in front of the net: Cause the opponent to make mistakes by side spin or back spin.

## How to master Spin

The spin in a pickleball is hardly produced by rubbing the ball using the racket, but rather by the different positions where the racket hits the ball. Therefore, when using the spin to control the trajectory of the ball, it is important to focus on hitting the ball mainly, and cooperate with the friction.

There are several ways to practice spin, and you need to feel the different spins caused by hitting different positions of the ball:

* Swing the ball to create Spin: let the ball bounce on the racket, and experience different Spins when cutting the ball in different directions;
* Serving to create Spin: hit different positions of the ball, send the ball with different Spins, and observe the trajectory after it hits the ground;
* Return the ball to create Spin: hit the ball at different positions, return the ball with different Spins, and observe its flight path.
