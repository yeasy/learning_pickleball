# Master Spin

Spin is an important charm of ball games. Reasonable adoption of spin can allow to control the ball in a better way.

## Spin types

According to the direction of Spin, it can be divided into the following categories:

* Topspin: The ball rolls forward rapidly, causing the trajectory to fall sharply, and the ball path is shorter than that of non-spinning balls;
* Backspin: The ball rolls back quickly, resulting in a flatter trajectory and a longer ball path than a non-spinning ball;
* Sidespin: Including left-spin or right-spin, the ball will deviate in the direction of Spin.

## When to use Spin

Pickleball's spin is relatively weak (generally less than 10 revolutions per second), and because of the smooth paddle surface, spin plays a lesser role when hitting.

Consider using Spin in the following scenarios:

* Serve: Use top spin or side spin to cause the opponent's judgment error on the ball's trajectory;
* Dink: Use varioud spins to cause the opponent to hit the ball at a discomfortable position;
* Drive or lob: Use topspin to avoid letting the ball go out;
* Volley: Use back spin or side spin to cause the opponent to fail to return the ball;
* ATP: Use side spin to let the ball land into the court from outside.

## How to master Spin

The spin of a pickleball is hardly produced by only rubbing it using the paddle, but rather by hitting the different positions of the ball and pushing the ball around. Therefore, when using the spin to control the trajectory of the ball, it is important to focus on hitting the ball mainly, and cooperate with a following push.

There are several ways to practice spin, and you need to feel the different spins caused by hitting different positions of the ball:

* Bounce the ball to create Spin: let the ball bounce on the paddle, and make different spins when cutting the ball in different directions;
* Serve to create Spin: hit different positions of the ball, send the ball with different spins, and observe the trajectory after it bounces from the ground;
* Return to create Spin: hit the coming ball at different positions, return the ball with different spins, and observe its flight trajectory.
