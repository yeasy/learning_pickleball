# Singles Game Strategies

The singles game of pickleball requires the highest comprehensive ability.

It not only requires the player's running ability and hitting skills, but also demands the psychological quality and the ability to control the rhythm of the game.

## Basic Process

Suppose the two players are A and B. A is serving first.

A serves the ball to B, and B tries to return the ball to near A's baseline position, and try to let it land far from A's prepared position.

At the same time, B tried to follow the ball to go to the net to prepare volleying the ball.

A tries to let B run by driving the ball or dropping the ball.

Suppose B successfully blocks the ball in front of the net, pushes the ball to A's backcourt or mobilizes A's angle near the net.

At this moment, A and B enter the mutual position mobilizing phase. If one player has a gap, or the return quality is not good, it will be attacked and enter the stage of offense and defense. Unlike doubles, players in the backcourt often do not have to use the drop technique to return to the net, but can flexibly choose driving, dropping, or lobbing to force the opponent to run.

In singles, the player needs to cover the whole court, it is generally necessary to find offensive opportunities by mobilizing the opponent's position, or to suppress the opponent to the backcourt.

Once the player is suppressed to the backcourt, it is at a big disadvantage. At this situation, if the player returns the ball too high, the opponent can volley the ball to earn the score.

## Key Points

The key to a singles match is to control the rhythm, so try to let the opponent move as much as possible, while you try to maintain a stable position. In addition, you should go to the net as quickly as possible when you have the opportunity, while pushing the opponent to stay at the backcourt.

* Defense at the net: After receiving the serve, you must go to the net as soon as possible to block the opponent's 3rd shot. Pay attention to defending wide-angle placement on both sides;
* Control the placement: It’s very important to accurately control the placement of the ball. Any drive must pass the opponent's interception area in front of the net, otherwise it is easy to be blocked;
* Use angles: Use more angles when attacking, such as the backhand position. At the same time, mobilize the opponent to run first, and be careful to avoid returning the ball too long and going out of bounds.
