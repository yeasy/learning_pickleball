# Master Footwork

Footwork is the soul of all ball sports. 

Excellent footwork allows players to always hit the ball in a comfortable position. Conversely, without good footwork, players have to hit the ball during moving, which causes more mistakes.

The purpose of footwork is to leave enough time and space for the body to hit the ball from a comfortable position.

## Footwork Types

Common footwork includes stride step, cross steps, jump step, and skip step.

**Stride Steps** refers to the action of striding the legs out in the direction of motion. The stride is large and is generally used for the last step in running, which can help stabilize the body.

**Cross Steps** are the movements of moving your legs crossed quickly. Cross steps are smaller steps and are generally used to move quickly or fine-tune your body position.

**Jumping Steps** to the action of moving quickly by jumping. The jumping speed is the fastest and the moving distance is the largest. It is generally used in the situation when you do not have enough time to hit the ball by running. You need to stabilize the body as soon as possible after landing.

**Skiping Steps** are small jumps to quickly adjust the body to prepare to hit the ball or prepare to move.

Single game player has a larger running range and can use the Cross or Stride steps mainly with the running movements. In doubles games, the players covered range is mostly not far, hence players can more Cross or Skipping steps, and pay attention to properly lowering the body and improve the stability for the shot.
