# Serve and Return

The purpose of serving and receiving is to prepare for the next shot, and to avoid giving the opponent a good attacking or approaching net opportunity.

In high-level games, it is generally difficult to score directly by serving or receiving.

In singles games, because players have to cover the entire court, the quality requirements for serving and receiving are often higher.

## Position

Similar to other ball games, players need to maintain a stable and comfortable stance, usually with legs slightly wider than shoulders, knees slightly bent, and stand in a neutral position, ready to run at all times. 

Focus is partly on the opposing player's position and movement, and partly on the ball.

## Grip the Paddle

The continental grip method should generally be used, that is, a posture similar to shaking hands or holding a hammer.

The clapping hand should be properly relaxed, the palm of the hand should be left empty, and at the same time, the index finger can lightly touch or place on the racket. If the full firmly holding score is 10 points, it is enough to achieve 3 points at most time.

## Serve

The ball should be served to the diagonal court with an underhand motion. Usually serve the ball as far as possible to let it land near the baseline (but not out), in order to hamper the opponent's return. When serving, you can probe the opponent's return by serving to various places (e.g., the opponent's forehand position, backhand position or middle position). Generally, fast balls are more threatening than slow balls.

In single games, the long serve can be combined with a short servee and a flat servee to mobilize the opponent's position.

In double games, usually serve fast balls near the middle to force the opponent to return the ball with low quality and not be able to quickly go to the net.

If the opponent's position is not neutral, or cannot run quickly, you can mobilize the opponent to proactively by serving.

## Master the Serve

The power of the serve action comes from thrusting the ground and turning the waist while swinging the arm to send the ball smoothly. Before hitting the pickleball, the body should be in a relaxed state. At the moment of hitting the ball, release your body power to the ball through the clap hand by whipping.

Because the pickleball is relatively smooth, the serve should generally use more hit with some spin. Players should at least master no-spin serve and topspin serve.

You can train your serve quickly with multiple balls. Subject to being able to serve continuously to the designated area, a group of 50, no less than 10 groups of practice every day.

At present, the international rules of competition do not encourage adding too much spin, so players should focus more on hitting serve.

## Return

When returning the serve, players should follows the ball to the net and forces the opponent to stay in the backcourt. Therefore, the returning ball should also land as close as possible to the baseline. The return ball can be returned by a hitting action, or a chopping action. When you want to have more time to run to the net, you can return the ball high and let it fall to the opponent's backcourt.

In single games, you can return the ball to the area far from the opponent more often, in order to let the opponent return the ball while moving.

In double games, the ball can be returned to the space between the opponent's two players (may be slightly biased to the backhand position), causing trouble when the opponent receives the ball. If the level of the opponent's two players is quite different, you can return the ball to the weaker player.
