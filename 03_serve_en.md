# Serve and Return

The purpose of serving and receiving is to prepare for the next shot, and to avoid giving the opponent a good attacking or going to net opportunity.

In high-level games, it is generally difficult to score directly by serving or receiving.

## Grip the Paddle

The surface of the pick racket is relatively smooth, and the Chinese grip method should generally be used, that is, a posture similar to holding a scalpel or a kitchen knife.

The clapping hand should be properly relaxed, the palm of the hand should be left empty, and at the same time, the index finger can be lightly placed on the racket.

## Serve

Pick the ball as far as possible to land near the opponent's bottom line, in order to increase the difficulty of the opponent's return. When serving, you can test the opponent's return by serving to the opponent's forehand position, backhand position and middle position.

In singles, the serve can be combined with a short ball and a flat ball to mobilize the opponent's position.

In doubles, send high balls or fast balls in the middle to force the opponent to return the ball with low quality and not be able to quickly surf the net.

If the opponent's stance is off, or the running is slow, you can mobilize the opponent to take the initiative by serving.

## Master the Serve

The power of the serve action comes from kicking the ground and turning the waist while swinging the big arm to send the ball smoothly. Before hitting the pickleball, the body should be in a relaxed state. At the moment of hitting the ball, release your body power to the ball through the clap hand.

Because the pickle ball is relatively smooth, it should generally be hit more often with a small amount of spin.

You can train your serve quickly with multiple balls. Subject to being able to serve continuously to the designated area, a group of 50, no less than 10 groups of practice every day.

## Return

When returning the serve, one's own team follows the ball to the net and forces the opponent to stay in the backcourt. Therefore, the receiving and serving should also fall as close as possible to the opponent's bottom line. The return ball can be returned by a topspin action, or by a chipping action. When you want to give yourself more time to run, you can return the ball high and let it fall slowly to the opponent's backcourt.

In singles, you should return the ball to the opponent's space more often, causing the opponent to return the ball while running.

In doubles, the ball should be returned to the space between the opponent's two players (may be slightly biased to the backhand position), causing trouble when the opponent receives the ball. If the level of the opponent's two players is quite different, you can return the ball to the weaker player.
