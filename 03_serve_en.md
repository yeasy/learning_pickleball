# Serve and Return

The purpose of serving and receiving is to prepare for the next shot, and to avoid giving the opponent a good attacking or approaching net opportunity.

In high-level games, it is generally difficult to score directly by serving or receiving.

## Position

Similar to other ball games, players need to maintain a stable and comfortable stance, usually with legs slightly wider than shoulders, knees slightly bent, and stand in a neutral position, ready to run at all times. 

Focus partly on the opposing player and partly on the ball.

## Grip the Paddle

The surface of the pick racket is relatively smooth, and the continental grip method should generally be used, that is, a posture similar to shaking hands or holding a kitchen knife.

The clapping hand should be properly relaxed, the palm of the hand should be left empty, and at the same time, the index finger can be lightly placed on the racket. If the full score is 10 points, it is enough to achieve 3 points at most time.

## Serve

The ball should be served to the diagonal court with an underhand motion. Usually serve the ball as far as possible to let it land near the bottom line (but not out), in order to hamper the opponent's return. When serving, you can probe the opponent's return by serving to the opponent's forehand position, backhand position or middle position. Generally, fast balls are more threatening than slow balls.

In single games, the long serve can be combined with a short servee and a flat servee to mobilize the opponent's position.

In double games, usually serve fast balls near the middle to force the opponent to return the ball with low quality and not be able to quickly go to the net.

If the opponent's position is not neutral, or cannot run quickly, you can mobilize the opponent to proactively by serving.

## Master the Serve

The power of the serve action comes from kicking the ground and turning the waist while swinging the big arm to send the ball smoothly. Before hitting the pickleball, the body should be in a relaxed state. At the moment of hitting the ball, release your body power to the ball through the clap hand.

Because the pickleball is relatively smooth, the serve should generally use more hit with some spin. Players should at least master topspin and no-spin serve.

You can train your serve quickly with multiple balls. Subject to being able to serve continuously to the designated area, a group of 50, no less than 10 groups of practice every day.

## Return

When returning the serve, one's own team follows the ball to the net and forces the opponent to stay in the backcourt. Therefore, the returning ball should also fall land as close as possible to the opponent's bottom line. The return ball can be returned by a topspin action, or by a chipping action. When you want to give yourself more time to run, you can return the ball high and let it fall slowly to the opponent's backcourt.

In single games, you can return the ball to the area far from the opponent more often, causing the opponent to return the ball while running.

In double games, the ball can be returned to the space between the opponent's two players (may be slightly biased to the backhand position), causing trouble when the opponent receives the ball. If the level of the opponent's two players is quite different, you can return the ball to the weaker player.
