# Doubles Game Strategies

Double games are common in pickleball, and the core part is the efficient collaboration between players.

## Basic Process

The main process of doubles is divided into two stages: a) **Move from the backcourt to the NVZ**, and b) **Battle near the net**.

Suppose the two teams are A and B, respectively, including two players A1, A2, B1, B2.

A1 is serving, and B2 is standing in front of the net, as shown in the figure.

A1 serves the ball to the diagonal opponent B1. B1 tries to return the ball to the baseline of team A, and at the same time, B1 follows the ball to run to the net.

At this moment, two players of team B are in front of the net to try attacking, and two players of team A are in the backcourt.

Assuming A2 will hit the third shot, A1 takes a step forward and prepares to go to the net, while observing the third shot. A2 hits the third shot by dropping the ball, and A2 follows the ball to go to the net at the same time. Now the phase of going to the net ends.

Now, the players of team A and B are both in front of the net, the game enters the most critical **near net battle phase**.

Usually players use the Dink technique to mobilize the opponents, and try to create attack opportunities. Because only the serving team can get a point in the rally, they should be more aggressive to try to attack.

Assuming that A1 returns the ball too high, B1 gets the opportunity and takes the initiative to attack. The two sides enter the fast volley interaction. One party can return to the battle in front of the net again by taking the initiative to Dink.

Assuming that the return quality by the team A is not good and the ball is pushed to the backcourt by the team B, at this time, the team A should try to go back to the net again by dropping the ball. The team B suppresses the team A players in the backcourt by giving long balls in succession, and try to find opportunities to volley to score.

There are two important steps in the doubles games.

One is the third shot, which decides whether the players can go to the net safely. For the serving side, if there is no high-quality third shot, they will be suppressed at the back court, and it will be difficult to have a chance to earn score in the following rounds. The third shot can be driving the ball (more offensive) or dropping to the net (more defensive). The fourth shot should try to keep the opponent in the backcourt. If you can volley, try to volley directly, and pay attention to the return route to avoid the opponent's poach. If you can't volley, wait for the ball to bounce off the ground and hit a higher-quality dink.

The other is the battle in front of the network. The two sides look for attack opportunities through the competition in front of the net and then try to force the opponent to the backcourt. Any side will be at a big disadvantage when suppressed to the backcourt. If the ball is returned too high from back court, it is easy for the opponent to smash the ball from near the net and score directly.

It should be noted that the Dinking in front of the net usually is using the diagonal direction or to the middle. Watch out for the opponent’s ATP attack when the ball lands close to the sideline. Be careful to defend the opponent's Erne attack when the ball is passing the net near its side.

## Key Points

In doubles, the cooperation of the players is often more important than the individual ability. The two players should play as a whole, rather than simply each player responsible for half of the court.

Typically, one of the two players should be the dominant attacker (usually the more capable player, such as a male player in mixed doubles) who will do most of the attacking, and the other should be the controller who will help defend and create offensive opportunities. The dominant player should take the initiative to deal with most of the shots, and the game controller should reset the opponent's offensive attempts and resolutely deny the opponent a good offensive opportunity.

In addition, both sides should try to let the controller return the ball. If there is no good offensive opportunity, pay attention to the shot quality to avoid creating a good offensive opportunity for the opponent.

* Positioning: try to stay near the net to hit the ball, and try to keep the opponents in the back court. The dominant attacker should cover at least 2/3 of the court, while the controller should pay attention to protect the sideline on his/her side;
* Protection of the middle ball: The middle position protection between the two players should be negotiated in time. When both can return the ball well, the forehand player or the higher skill level player should have the priority to return.
* Protection of the backcourt ball: The backcourt ball should be handled by the one close to the backcourt or the one with faster footwork to catch the ball.

## Offensive Third Shot: Shake and Bake

Traditional strategy favors the third-shot drop for safe transition to the net. However, in modern professional play, the offensive third shot (Shake and Bake) has become increasingly common.

### Strategy Overview

The offensive third shot consists of two parts:
*   **Shake (Drive)**: One player hits a fast, powerful third-shot drive, targeting the return player or the gap between opponents;
*   **Bake (Poach Volley)**: Simultaneously, the partner rushes to the net to intercept the opponent's defensive return.

### When to Use

*   When the opponent's return is poor—high or long;
*   When your team has strong driving ability and the opponents have weak defense;
*   When you want to break the opponent's rhythm and actively seek points.

### Technique

*   The driving player should hit a fast, low drive, targeting the opponent's feet or the middle gap;
*   The volleying partner should rush to the net simultaneously, ready to intercept;
*   If the opponent successfully defends, be prepared to reset into a dinking rally.

## Mixed Doubles Strategy

In mixed doubles, the skill gap between male and female players requires thoughtful division of responsibilities.

### Positioning Principles

*   **Male Player as Dominant**: Responsible for 2/3 or more of the court, actively handling most attacks and middle balls;
*   **Female Player as Controller**: Responsible for sideline defense, resetting the opponent's attacks, and creating offensive opportunities;
*   **Protect the Female Player**: Opponents typically target the female player, so the male player should actively cover and protect.

### Offensive Strategy

*   **Target the Female Player**: Create more pressure on the opponent's female player's side;
*   **Move the Male Player**: Use wide-angle shots to move the opponent's male player, creating opportunities to attack the female player;
*   **Middle Ball Coordination**: Middle balls should be handled by the male player primarily to avoid confusion.

### Defensive Strategy

*   **Female Player Prioritizes Resets**: When under pressure, the female player should focus on stable resets rather than forcing attacks;
*   **Male Player Covers Actively**: When the female player is pulled wide, the male player should quickly cover;
*   **Communication**: Use verbal calls to clarify who takes the ball, avoiding both players going for or leaving the same ball.

## Stacking

Stacking is a tactical positioning commonly used in mixed doubles and same-gender doubles, allowing both players to maintain their most advantageous court positions.

### What is Stacking

According to the rules, players must stand in their designated half during serve and return. However, after the serve/return, players can move freely. Stacking means that after serving or returning, both players quickly adjust to fixed positions (e.g., male player always on the left, female player always on the right).

### Advantages of Stacking

*   **Maximize Forehand Coverage**: Both players' forehands face the middle, strengthening middle-court protection;
*   **Fixed Responsibilities**: Players always cover the same areas, improving coordination;
*   **Play to Strengths**: Allows the stronger player to cover more territory.

### Disadvantages of Stacking

*   **Longer Movement**: Players must quickly switch positions after serving/returning, consuming more energy;
*   **Short Switching Window**: If the opponent's return is fast, there may not be enough time to complete the switch;
*   **Potential Gaps**: Defensive gaps may appear during the switching process.

### Executing Stacking

*   **On Serve**: The server moves quickly to their target position after serving; the partner simultaneously moves in the opposite direction;
*   **On Return**: The returner switches positions quickly after hitting the second shot; the partner moves accordingly;
*   **Timing**: The switch should be completed before the opponent hits the ball, otherwise gaps may be exploited.
