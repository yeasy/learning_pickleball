# Singles strategy

The core of singles is to control the rhythm, try to let the opponent run as much as possible, and avoid losing the center of gravity. In addition, you should take the initiative to attack when you have the opportunity.

## Basic process

Suppose the two players are A and B. A is the serving side.

A sends the ball to B, and B tries to return the ball to A's baseline position, and try to let it stay far from A's prepared position.

At the same time, B tried to follow to volley in front of the net.

After A catches the ball, let B run by pulling the ball or dropping the ball.

B successfully intercepts in front of the net, pushes the ball to A's backcourt or mobilizes A's net.

At this time, A and B enter the mutual transfer position link. If one side has a gap, or the quality of the return ball is not high, it will be attacked and enter the stage of offense and defense. Unlike doubles, players in the backcourt often do not have to use the lob technique to return to the net, but flexibly combine the ball or pick the ball to mobilize the opponent.

It can be seen that in singles, it is generally necessary to find offensive opportunities by mobilizing the opponent's position, or to suppress the opponent to the backcourt.

Once one side is suppressed to the backcourt, it is at a disadvantage. At this time, if the ball is returned too high, it is easy for the opponent to smash the ball and score.

## gist

* Drive ball control: In singles, there are many applications to drive the ball, and it is necessary to precisely control the drive point of the ball. It must be intercepted by the opponent in front of the net, otherwise it is easy to fall into passive;
* Angle control: To open the angle, try to let the opponent move, and at the same time avoid returning the ball too long to be out.
