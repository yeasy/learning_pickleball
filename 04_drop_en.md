# Releasing technology

Drop technology is the core technology in the doubles event of the pickleball. If you don't master the drop technique, you can't progress to a higher level.

## What is a net

Putting the net refers to the action of placing the ball in the opponent's NVZ area in the middle and backcourt (as close as possible to the front half), and at the same time running to the frontcourt or in front of the net before the opponent returns the ball.

It can be simply understood that putting a tennis ball is the Dink ball of the far net.

Similarly, tennis balls can also be divided into three types: straight balls, diagonal balls and intermediate balls:

* Straight ball: The straight ball has a shorter trajectory and is usually easier to control, but is prone to a higher or farther trajectory. At the same time, the ball lands earlier, and the time spent online is shorter;
* Cross-court Ball: A cross-court Ball is when the ball is dropped into the opposing opponent's area. The distance is longer, the ball lands later, and you have more time to go to the net.
* Middle ball: The middle ball refers to placing the ball in the space between the two opponents. Since both of them can catch the ball, it will cause some trouble to judge in time.

## When to use the net

When your side is in the middle and backcourt and the other side is waiting in front of the net, at this time, you can let your side run to the front of the net by releasing the net to form a stalemate.

The main purpose of putting tennis balls is to let oneself run to the net quickly and form a stalemate with the opponent's net.

## How to master the net

When setting the net, avoid returning the ball too far and too high, so that the opponent can volley the ball.

When you have mastered the Dink ball, you can do net training.

First, take a step back from the NVZ line, and do not exceed this distance for fixed-point net training. After mastering it, take a step back for training until you retreat to the backcourt line for netting training.

After mastering the fixed-point net setting training, you can carry out the net setting training while running. The sparring team hits the ball to the backcourt, and the players release the net and follow the ball to the front of the net to form a stalemate.
