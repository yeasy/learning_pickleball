# How to Dink

Dink technology is the most basic technology of pickleball and the premise of other technologies. If you don't master the Dink technique, you can't play pickle well.

## What is Dink

Dink refers to the action of placing the ball in the opponent's NVZ area in front of the net. Usually the trajectory is flat, which goes over the net in a low position (within a ball height is good), and it falls into the front half of the opponent's NVZ area or near the area line.

Dink is often used in doubles events. According to the target area, it can be roughly divided into the following three types:

* Straight ball: Straight ball is to put the ball into the opponent's area that you are facing. For example, stand on your left hemisphere and place the ball in your opponent's right half. Straight balls are usually easier to control, but tend to have a higher or farther trajectory, making it easier for the opponent to handle;
* Cross-court ball: A cross-court Ball is when the ball is dropped into the opposing opponent's area. For example, stand on the left hemisphere and place the ball into the opponent's left half court. The cross-court ball has a longer distance. It is not easy to intercept because it passes through the middle of the net, and it has a certain angle after landing, which makes it more difficult for the opponent to deal with.
* Middle ball: The middle ball refers to placing the ball in the space between the two opponents. Since both of them can catch the ball, it will cause some trouble to judge in time.

## When to use Dink

When the ball from the opponent falls into the front area of ​​the NVZ and waits in front of the net, usually wait for the ball to bounce and then use the Dink ball to return.

The main purpose of the Dink ball is to defend and find opportunities in the stalemate.

## How to master Dink

Dink needs to avoid returning the ball too far and too high, so that the opponent can form a volley and press down. Therefore, you should lower the center of the body, and let the ball pass the net in a low position, and drop downward.

There are several ways to achieve the Dink effect, the easiest and most efficient way is to push the ball.

When pushing the ball, you should pay attention to the relatively fixed wrist, control the angle of the racket to be stable, and send the ball through the forearm without triggering the racket, so that the ball falls to the target landing point. In order to ensure the stability of the ball trajectory, the racket should continue to follow the ball for about a foot after hitting the ball. When Dinking for defense, the ball's landing point should be in the first half of the NVZ to avoid the opponent's attack; in order to mobilize the opponent, when the opponent is standing near the net, the ball can also be be placed near the NVZ line (e.g, the side corners).

After mastering the push Dink, you can appropriately add spin to make it more difficult for the opponent to make a high-quality return, including:

* Topspin: squeeze the return space, and at the same time cause the opponent to return the ball too long and too high;
* Backspin: The bounce is low with backspin. It is more difficult to control the force to return the ball perfectly, and the returned ball is easy to get off the net;
* Side spin: The angle of the ball is large. It is more difficult to control the route when returning the ball, and it is more possible to go out or be predicted.

When doing Dink training, keep in mind:

* keep patient;
* The body can move and sway with the ball, but the center of gravity should remain stable when hitting the ball;
* Hit the ball in front of you always;
* The wrist should be fixed, and use the shoulder to drive the arm to exert force.

Dink rely a lot on hands sensitivity, so special touch practice is required first.

* Bumping practice: Use the racket to continuously flip the ball, you can control the height of the ball, control the ball to rotate or not, and you can use the front and back rackets to flip the ball alternately. There should be no less than 100 consecutive strokes at a time, and no less than 5 sets of exercises should be carried out every day.
* Multi-ball practice: The sparring staff hit the ball into the NVZ, and the player Dinks the ball into the designated target area, and the ball does not go too high over the net. There should be no less than 50 consecutive Dinks each time, and no less than 10 sets of exercises per day. Practice the straight ball first, and then practice the cross-court ball after stabilization.
* Dynamic practice: sparring staff and players move horizontally in front of the net while Dink training.
