# Basic Knowledge

Pickleball, as an emerging sport born in the 1960s, has swept North America and attracted more and more attention worldwide.

Pickle ball combines the characteristics of tennis, badminton, table tennis and other sports. It is fun to play, easy to learn, and moderate in activity and not easy to be injured. It can be described as suitable for all ages. Anyone in their 70s or 80s, or children in their teens, can participate.

## The Origin of Pickleball

In the summer of 1965, the pickleball was invented by Congressman Joel Pritchard and his neighbors Barney McCallum and Bill Bell while vacationing on Bainbridge Island in Seattle, USA.
 
It is said that they both like to play tennis and badminton, but because of the high threshold, they cannot play with their families. So they wanted to invent a sport that the elderly and children could also participate in. After a comprehensive study of tennis, badminton, table tennis and other projects, the three inventors chose a moderate field size, used a wooden racket, and designed a slow-flying plastic ball, which greatly lowered the threshold for getting started. Everyone fell in love with the movement all at once, and it spread.
 
When playing Pickle, a pet dog named "Pickle" likes to run after the ball, so the inventor named it Pickle.
 
To commemorate the invention of the pickleball, the World Pickleball Championship since 2017 named its trophy the "Bainbridge Cup". The first three championships were won by its country of origin, the United States.

## Basic Rules

The size of the Peak Court is 44x20 feet (about 13.4x6.1 meters), and the net height is 34~36 inches (about 88.36~91.44 cm), which is the same size as the badminton court. Therefore, it is very convenient to raise the net to play badminton and lower it to play pickle on the same field.

Pickle balls used in official competitions are slightly larger than tennis balls. They are made of hard plastic and are mostly yellow or orange (indoor balls are different from outdoor balls, the indoor balls are slightly softer and have fewer holes). A circular hole with a diameter of less than 1cm, which makes the rotation not too violent, and the ball speed is not fast. Therefore, people sometimes jokingly call the pickleball as seniors' tennis.

The racket of the pickle ball is like a large table tennis racket, with a length of 15.5~17 inches (39.37~43.18 cm) and a width of 7~8.25 inches (17.78~20.96 cm). It was originally made of wood, and later glass fiber and carbon fiber were used. and other new materials. The racket has little elasticity and a smooth surface. Pickleball is easy to play, but getting better at it takes skill, patience and teamwork.

Pickleball scoring is similar to tennis, but only the server can score points during their round.

Taking doubles as an example, each game has 11 points, and each player on the serving side has one chance to serve. After serving, the opponent receives the serve and returns, and the serving party hits the ball to the opposite side again, and can then start volleying the ball that has not landed. If the serving team scores in the serving round, then switch sides with teammates and continue serving. Players can only score points in their own serving rounds, and the receiving team will not add points even if they win the round.

In addition, the area before the net is called "Kitchen (Kitchen) or non-volley zone (None Volley Zone, NVZ)". Competitors are not allowed to step into this area before and after the volley.

## Pickerball Features

Pickleball incorporates elements of badminton, table tennis and tennis. A group of four players in a regular play has a playing field that is only about one-quarter the size of a tennis court, making it easier to run and exert power when playing.

Pickleball has the characteristics of easy to use, easy to control, moderate exercise (not as high as tennis and badminton for bouncing and running), etc. The reasons are: the activity field of pickleball is not large (smaller than tennis court), and the weight of pickleball is relatively high. Light (only more than 20 grams) and does not have high elasticity, the racket is light in weight and has a large area of the blade. Therefore, pickleballs can be played in singles or doubles, indoor and outdoor venues, and are loved by people of different ages.

The overall activity of the pickleball is moderate. In addition to drives, lobs, and slices, there are also volleys and high balls. The competition between the two sides is not about strength or speed, but about control of the ball. In doubles, teamwork is especially important. Pickleball does not have high requirements on the serving link, and the number of rounds is often more, which is quite ornamental.
