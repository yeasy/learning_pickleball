# Key Tips


* Being able to control the ball softly is more useful than hitting it hard.
* Never play games before the correct action becomes your subconscious reaction.
* Drop is the far-net Dink; Dink is the near-net Drop. The goal of both is to defend (a.k.a., not gift an opportunity to the opponents).
* The most effective way of Dink and Drop is to push, rather than to drive or to spin.
* Lob must pass the opponent's top. High ball is not easy to go out.
* The ball flying over waist in the midfield will go out in most cases.
* Footwork is more important than hand technique. Run into position before playing.
* Return ball to an opponent in the backcourt, otherwise, to the weaker player.
* Run to the net as soon as possible and keep the opponents in the backcourt.
* If you don't know where to go, return the ball to the gap between the opponents.
* A bad racket potentially affects your performance, but a good racket may not necessarily improve your real level.
