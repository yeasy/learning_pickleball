# Key Tips

## Strategies
* Take advantage of one's own strengths and attack others' weaknesses; first stand undefeated, and then defeat others.
* Never play games before the correct action becomes your subconscious reaction.
* Being able to control power is more important than power itself. Controlling means that the same gesture can add or reduce power, spin or not, even change the angle.
* Footwork is more important than hand technique. Run into position before playing.
* Don't stick to any rule, and make adjustments at any time according to the opponent's situation.
* An oridinary paddle potentially affects your performance, but a high-end paddle may not necessarily improve your real level.

## Tactics

* If the opponent's footwork is poor, let him run more; if the opponent's reaction is fast, slow down the pace; if the opponent's near-net skill is good, play more long balls, otherwise, play wide angles.
* Drop is the far-net Dink; Dink is the near-net Drop. The first goal of both is not gifting an opportunity to the opponents.
* The most effective way of Dink and Drop is to push, rather than to drive or to spin.
* Lob must pass the opponent's top. High ball is not easy to go out.
* The ball flying over waist in the midfield will go out in most cases.
* Return ball to an opponent in the backcourt, otherwise, to the weaker player.
* Run to the net as soon as possible and keep the opponents in the backcourt.
* If you don't know where to go, return the ball to the gap between the opponents.
* Adjust the rhythm of your breathing, and hit the ball when you exhale, which makes the ball more stable.
