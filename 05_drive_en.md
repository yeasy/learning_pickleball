# Drive technique

The drive technique is the closest to the tennis technique of the pickleball.

## What is a Drive

Drive is the act of hitting the ball quickly so that the ball flies forward quickly.

It can be roughly divided into the far net Drive, the middle net Drive, and the near net Drive.

* Far-net Drive: The far-net Drive is similar to the action of serving a ball. By Driveing the ground and turning the waist, swinging the big arm, driving the forearm, and finally whipping the ball. The general target is the opponent's midfield.
* Midfield Drive: The near-net Drive is a transition by hitting when the opponent returns to the midfield and jumps higher. The general target is the opposing midfielder.
* Close-net Drive: The close-net is to attack the ball by hitting the ball when the opponent's return is shorter and the ball bounces high. Care should be taken to control the running trajectory not to cross the net too high,

## When should the Drive be used

When the ball jumps high after landing, or the opponent does not form an effective net block, you can try to Drive the ball.

The main purpose of swiping the ball is to mobilize the opponent, or make the opponent return the ball in a hurry and the quality is not high, so as to form a chance for the next shot.

## How to master the Drive

The most important thing in slamming the ball is to hit the ball in front of you, and to master the force of the whip, and release the force of turning the waist through the stable hitting surface formed by the clap hand.

It should be noted that the surface of the pickle ball and racket is relatively smooth. In most cases, the Drive should be based on hitting, supplemented by rotation.

In doubles, the target of the Drive can generally be between two opposing players, or in a defensive space. When the opponent's defensive ability is weak, you can also deliberately play a close ball (such as holding a clapping shoulder, etc.), causing the opponent to make mistakes.
