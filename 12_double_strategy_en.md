# Doubles Strategy

Doubles is a common type in pickleball, and its core lies in the close cooperation between players. If there is no good opportunity, the defense should be the first.

## Basic Process

Suppose the two teams are A and B, respectively, including two players A1, A2, B1, B2. Team A is the serving team.

A1 sends the ball to the opponent B1 (B2 is standing in front of the net at this time), B1 tries to return the ball to the bottom line of team A, and at the same time, follows to the front of the net.

At this time, two players of team B are in front of the net, and two players of team A are in the backcourt.

Assuming the ball hits A2, A1 takes a step forward and prepares to net. A2 catches the ball, chooses to release the net, and follows the ball to the net at the same time.

At this time, the players of team A and B are in front of the net.

Then enter the most critical pre-net process, usually using the Dink ball to mobilize the opponent. Assuming that A1 returns the ball too high, B1 gets the opportunity and takes the initiative to draw the ball. The two sides entered the fast volley link. One party can return to the stalemate in front of the net again by taking the initiative to Dink.

Assuming that the quality of the ball returned by the A side is not high and is pushed to the backcourt by the B side, at this time, the A side should try to surf the net again by releasing the net. The B side suppresses the A side players in the backcourt by giving long balls in succession.

It can be seen that in the doubles process, the stalemate in front of the net plays a crucial role. Through the stalemate, you should find offensive opportunities or be able to suppress the opponent to the backcourt.

Once one side is suppressed to the backcourt, it is at a disadvantage. At this time, if the ball is returned too high, it is easy for the opponent to smash the ball and score.

## Key Points

* Protection of the middle part: The middle position of the two people should be negotiated in advance. When both of them can return the ball, the forehand side or the higher level side should be given priority to catch the ball.
* Protection of the backcourt ball: The backcourt ball should be close to the backcourt side or the one with faster footwork to catch the ball.
