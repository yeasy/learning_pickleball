# Chopping technique

The chopping technique is a common defensive technique in Pickleball.

## What is chopping

chopping refers to sliding the middle and lower part of the ball to make the ball spin downward and fly to the opponent's court.

According to the trajectory height, the chopping can be roughly divided into the following three types:

* High ball: Slide the bottom of the ball, causing it to travel a higher trajectory. The golf ball is slower and can have more time to return the ball. Generally, it should fall into the NVZ area to prevent the opponent from pressing down and attacking;
* Medium and high ball: The medium and high ball refers to the middle and rear part of the main chip, which causes the ball's flight path to be a parabolic curve that is not too high. The middle and high balls are used the most and have a certain offensiveness. Generally, it should fall into the NVZ area to prevent the opponent from pressing down and attacking;
* Flat ball: The flat ball refers to the middle of the main cut ball, causing the ball's flight path to be a flat trajectory. The ball is faster and more aggressive.

## When should a chip be used

When the opponent hits the ball with strong backspin, or when the hitting point is low, you can use the chip.

Compared with the ball, the cutting action is small, and the ball path is easy to control. It is used for setting the net, which can bring more time to return the ball to one's own side.

Another situation is that when the opponent's return is high in front of the net, he can cooperate with the common shot to change the rhythm and placement, causing the opponent to make mistakes.

The main purpose of chopping the ball is to transition, to find opportunities for the next shot.

## How to master the slice

When cutting the ball, wrap the ball as much as possible, continue to act on the ball, and make the ball produce more rotation.

When cutting the ball, the body should be in a relaxed state, move to the forward direction of the ball in advance, turn the waist by kicking the ground, accelerate the force against the ball, and send the ball out.

Slices depend more on hand feel, so special touch practice is required.

* Slicing practice: Use the racket to slice the ball continuously, fall into the designated area, and pay attention to control the height of the trajectory. There should be no less than 50 consecutive slices each time, and no less than 10 sets of exercises should be performed every day.
* Multi-ball practice: The sparring staff will serve the ball at different speeds and heights, and the players will slice the ball into the designated target area. There should be no less than 50 consecutive slices each time, and no less than 10 sets of exercises should be performed every day.
