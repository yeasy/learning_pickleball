## What is Around The Post

Around The Post (ATP) is a common technique in professional tournaments, which refers to returning the ball from outside of the court and letting the ball fly to the court around the net post.

## When to Use

When the opponent player dinks a ball with a large angle, it is difficult for one's own side to hit back a high-quality dink. At this point, you can consider hitting the ball using ATP.

As shown in the picture below, the player returns the ball using ATP.

## How to Hit

The key to hit a ATP is moving to position quickly and choose the appropriate timing to do the shot.

Important tips for playing a high-quality ATP shot include:

* When hitting the ball, the player must stand out of the court. The farther to the outside, the greater the angle range of the return ball, and the easier the ball is to land in the court;
* The timing of hitting the ball should be as late as possible, wait for the ball to drop near the ground before hitting it, and avoid hitting the ball at a high point. This is different from other regular scenarios. The lower the shot, the lower the flight trajectory of the ball, and the harder it is for the opponent to defend;
* The main target of hitting the ball should be the opponent's backcourt, so that you can try to bypass the opponent's body and avoid the opponent's defense;
* After hitting the ball, return to the court as soon as possible.

## How to Defend

When the opponent hits an ATP shot, his position is usually on the outside of the court, and the target of the ball is the edge of the court on the same side. At this time, you should adjust your position as soon as possible to prepare for defense. 

Key points include:

* Stand facing the opponent and accurately judge his hitting intention;
* Follow the opponent's hitting rhythm, and wait for the opponent's hitting moment to block the opponent's hitting angle to the greatest extent;
* Try to volley to intercept, and adjust the surface of the paddle according to the height of the incoming ball. Especially when the opponent's incoming ball is low, take the initiative to hit the ball by chopping the ball, but don't let the ball pass the net too high;
* The first return target is the gap by the opponent's player to run off the court, and try to hit the ball to the backcourt. If it is observed that his teammates have the intention to run to the position, then can consider hitting the other side.

## Training Method

* Multi-ball practice: One player stands on the sidelines and repeatedly practice hitting the ATP. Another player practices defense;
* Interactive practice: Both sides simulate the game scene, practice hitting and defending ATP shots.
