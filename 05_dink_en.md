# How to Dink

Dink is the most common technology of pickleball and it's also the premise of other technologies. If you don't master the Dink, you can't play pickleball well.

## What is Dink

Dink refers to the action of placing the ball to the opponent's NVZ area. Usually the trajectory is flat, which goes over the net in a low position (within a ball height is good), and it falls into the front half of the opponent's NVZ area or near the NVZ line.

Dink is often used in doubles events. According to the target area, it can be roughly divided into the following three types:

* Straight Dink: Straight Dink is to put the ball into the opponent's area that you are facing. For example, stand on your left half court and place the ball in your opponent's right half court. Straight Dink is usually easier to hit, but tend to have a higher or farther trajectory, making it easier for the opponent to attack;
* Cross-court (Diagonal) Dink: A cross-court Dink is when the ball is dropped into the opposing opponent's area diagonally. For example, stand on the left half court and place the ball into the opponent's left half court. The cross-court ball has a longer trajectory. It is not easy to intercept because it passes through the middle of the net, and it has a side angle after landing, which makes it more difficult for the opponent to deal with. If the ball bounces off the ground and goes beyond the sideline of the court, be prepared that the opponent is possibly to use an Around-The-Post (ATP) hit.
* Middle Dink: The middle dink refers to placing the ball in the space between the two opponents. Since both players can handle the ball, it will cause some trouble to make the decision immediately.

## When to Use Dink

When the ball from the opponent falls into the NVZ and the opponents are ready to stay near the net, usually use the Dink ball to return to avoid giving a good attack opportunity to the opponents.

The first purpose of Dink is to prevent the opponents from having a good attack opportunity. Dink is for defending safely when there is no good opportunity. At the same time try to mobilize the opponent to find an attack opportunity in the rally.

## How to Master Dink

A good Dink will not return the ball too far and too high, otherwise the opponent can volley the ball and hit it down to attack. 

Therefore, you should stand close to the NVZ line, and lower the center of the body, and hit the ball softly to let it pass the net and drop downward in a low position.

There are several ways to master the Dink, the easiest and most efficient way is to push the ball.

When pushing the ball, you should keep your wrist relatively fixed, stabilize the paddle angle, and send the ball from the forearm without shaking the racket, so that the ball falls to the target landing point. In order to stabilize the ball's trajectory, the paddle should continue to follow the ball's movement for about a foot after hitting the ball. When dinking for defense, the ball's landing point should be in the first half of the NVZ to avoid the opponent's attack; in order to mobilize the opponent, when the opponent's standing is unstable, the ball can also be placed near the NVZ line (e.g, the side corners) or to the opponent's feet.

After mastering the push Dink, you can appropriately add spin to make it more difficult for a high-quality return, including:

* Top Spin: The ball's trajectory will drop sharply before landing, which causes the opponent to return the ball too long and too high. The trajectory of the topspin ball is relatively high, so generally use it in the diagonal direction;
* Back Spin: The ball's trajectory will be longer than expected to squeeze the return space, and the bounce is low with backspin, which make it more difficult to return the ball perfectly;
* Side Spin: The trajectory will have a side angle, which makes it more difficult to control the route when returning the ball.

When doing Dink training, keep in mind:

* keep patient when there's no good attack opportunity;
* The body can move and sway with the ball, move ahead of the ball's direction. And the center of body should remain stable when hitting the ball;
* Hit the ball in front of you, hit ball from the front of the ball, and hit the ball when exhale;
* The wrist should be fixed. Use the body and shoulder to drive the arm to exert force.

Dink relies a lot on hands sensitivity, so special touch practices are required.

* Bouncing practice: Use the racket to continuously flip the ball, you can control the height of the ball, control the ball to rotate or not, and you can use the forehand and backhand to flip the ball alternately. There should be no less than 100 consecutive strokes at a time, and no less than 5 sets of exercises should be carried out every day.
* Multi-ball practice: The assistant staff hits the ball into the NVZ, and the player Dinks the ball into the designated target area, and the ball does not go too high over the net. There should be no less than 50 consecutive Dinks each time, and no less than 10 sets of exercises per day. Practice the straight ball first, and then practice the cross-court ball after that.
* Dynamic practice: The assistant staff and players move horizontally along the net while dinking the ball.
