# Warm up and Relax

The secret to being able to play pickleball for a long time is to warm up well before playing and relax properly after the game. 

At the same time, good physical fitness is a prerequisite for high-level competition.

## How to fully warm up

The purpose of a warm-up is to activate the body's joints and associated muscles to avoid injury from sudden stress.

It should be done in the order from the whole to the part, from the large joint to the small joint.

* Active waist
* Active shoulders and arms
* Leg press and leg stretch
* Active wrist and ankle joints
* Jogging and jumping exercises

## How to relax reasonably

During intense exercise, muscle tissue undergoes a rapid contraction and relaxation process, which may cause the originally neatly arranged muscle fibers to cross and bend.

The purpose of relaxation is to relax the muscle tissue, bringing its fibers back into alignment.

Relaxation should be done by relaxing the large muscles first, followed by the small muscles.

* Relax waist muscles
* Relax back muscles
* Relax leg muscles
* Relax arm muscles

Relaxation can be done by stretching, pressing, etc., and can be done with equipment (such as rollers, yoga mats, etc.).
