Control the game with stillness and motion, focus more on control than on mere action.

Place yourself in an unassailable position, plan your moves with wisdom.

## Source of Power
The art of pickleball starts with generating power. Power begins in the feet, rising from the bottom up. It travels through the legs, hips, waist, back, shoulders, arms, and finally reaches the hands and fingers. The generation and cessation of power rely on breath control, with the flow of energy following inhalation and exhalation. The transmission of power is like the flow of a river: when unobstructed, it flows smoothly; when relaxed, it penetrates deeply. To generate power, one must be like a fully drawn bow, internally tight but externally relaxed; at the moment of exertion, like a wave crashing against a rock or a thunderbolt striking with immense force.

## Secrets of Hitting
The essence of pickleball lies in hitting the ball. There are three hitting techniques: the "direct hit," the "slice," and the "block." The direct hit uses straightforward force to defeat the opponent; the slice uses variations to confuse the opponent; the block uses placement to constrain the opponent. These three techniques are fundamentally one, complementing each other and each with its own strengths. Learners should progress step by step, practicing each in sequence until they can merge the variations of all three into a single hit.

## Precision of Hand Techniques
Hand techniques are the essence of pickleball. They consist of three key skills: gripping, hitting, and pushing. The grip is the foundation, hitting is the sharpness, and pushing provides stability. The palm is the root, and the fingers are the tools. The forehand should be powerful and steady, while the backhand should be light and agile. Advance by retreating, move left by moving right, achieve more with less, and win with skill over brute force. Learners should carefully understand and diligently practice until their hands and mind work in harmony, achieving effortless execution.

## Variability of Footwork
Footwork is the foundation of both defense and offense and the mother of hand techniques. It should be as fluid as a dragon and as agile as a returning swallow. Footwork varies in length and speed: short steps are useful for quick engagements, while long steps are advantageous for maneuvering. Movement should follow the body, allowing free advancement and retreat; when body and footwork are unified, one can move with ease. To refine footwork, one must first train the lower body, strengthening the hips, knees, ankles, and toes to become resilient and flexible, balancing strength and suppleness.

## Flexibility of Body Movement
Body movement is the core of technique, valued for its flexibility and adaptability. It should be responsive to the mind, able to initiate or withdraw as needed, controlling motion with stillness, and using movement to control the opponent. Body movement consists of three elements: stance, mobility, and turning. The stance must be stable, ready to act at any moment; mobility should be light, with power centered within, moving like flowing water, unhindered. Turning requires balance, with one foot as the pivot and the other in motion, changing direction smoothly and consistently.

## Subtlety of Mind
The contest in pickleball is not merely about momentary victories, but a test of strategy and wisdom. Mental techniques have three levels: first, "calm as a mountain," remaining steady and unshaken by external forces; second, "advance like fire," moving continuously with momentum; third, "change like the wind," adapting unpredictably and leaving no trace. Practitioners of mental techniques should constantly reflect and temper their minds until they reach a state of self-forgetfulness, achieving the ultimate level of mastery.

## The Path to Victory
The path to victory lies in knowing both oneself and the opponent. Identify the opponent's weaknesses, plan accordingly, and act with precision. Observe the opponent's tactics and adapt in response. Success requires a balance of skill and intellect, combining the real and the feigned to achieve invincibility. Beyond technique and strategy, one must govern the mind with principles and integrate the mind with technique to experience the vast expanse of mastery.
