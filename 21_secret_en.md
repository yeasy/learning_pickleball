## Source of Power
The art of pickleball begins with the generation of power. Power starts from the feet, moving upwards through the legs, hips, waist, back, shoulders, arms, palms, and finally the fingers. The root of power lies in breath, following the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. The transmission of power flows like a river, smooth when unblocked, penetrating when relaxed. To generate power, be like a drawn bow ready to release, tense internally but relaxed externally. At the moment of striking, it should be like waves crashing on rocks, or thunderbolts.

## Secrets of Hitting
The essence of pickleball lies in hitting the ball. There are three key techniques: the first is the "straight hit," the second is the "slice," and the third is the "lob." The straight hit uses direct force to overpower the opponent; the slice uses spin and variation to confuse the opponent; the lob uses height and placement to control the opponent. These three techniques are interconnected, each countering and complementing the other, each with its own strengths. One must master the ability to employ all three techniques within a single hit movement.

## Precision of Hand Techniques
Hand techniques are the essence of pickleball. The three main techniques are swing, hit, and push block, each with unique applications, working in harmony. Swinging is foundational, hitting is sharp, and pushing is steady. The palm is the root, the fingers the tool, winning with less and defeating the clumsy with cleverness. Move forward by moving backward, go left by going right. Techniques are varied and limitless. Learners should carefully understand and practice until achieving unity of mind and hand.

## Variations of Footwork
Footwork is the foundation of both offense and defense, the mother of hand technique. Its movement is like a swimming dragon, its turns like a returning swallow. Footwork varies in length and speed, sometimes swift, sometimes slow. To master this skill, one must prioritize stability, diligently training the strength of the lower body, focusing on the joints of the hips, knees, ankles, and toes. Short steps are suited for quick battles, while long steps facilitate maneuvering. Only when the steps follow the body's movements can one advance and retreat with ease. When body and steps are unified, one can move with skill and precision.

## Flexibility of Body Movement
Body movement is the core of technique. It must be flexible and versatile, effortlessly transitioning between stillness and motion, controlling the opponent. Body movement includes stance, movement, and turning. The stance must be stable, seemingly immobile but ready to move; movement must be lively, with power centered, flowing like clouds and water; turning must be balanced, with one foot as the axis and the other moving, changing direction without excess.

## Subtlety of Mind
The contest in pickleball is not merely about winning or losing, but a battle of wits and strategy. The mind has three states: "calm as a mountain," with a stable and unwavering heart; "advance like fire," with a relentless and fierce attack; "change like wind," with unpredictable variations. Practitioners should cultivate inner observation, honing their mind to reach a state of perfection.

## The Way to Victory
The key to victory lies in knowing yourself and your opponent. Identify the opponentâ€™s weaknesses, make plans before taking action, and adapt to the opponent's movements. Balance skill and wisdom, combine the real with the deception, and you will be invincible. Beyond technique and strategy, it is crucial to govern the mind with the Dao and integrate the heart with the method, only then can you fully experience the vastness of heaven and earth.
