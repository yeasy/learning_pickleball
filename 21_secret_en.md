## Chapter One: The Source of Using Power
The art of pickleball lies first in using power. Power begins in the feet, rising from the bottom up, through the legs, hips, waist, back, shoulders, arms, palms, and finally to the fingers. The transmission of power is like the flow of a river; when the path is clear, the power flows smoothly, and when the joints are aligned, the power penetrates. One who wishes to generate power efficiently should be like a fully drawn bow, tense on the inside but relaxed on the outside. When releasing power, it should be like a tidal wave crashing against rocks, delivering an instantaneous and overwhelming force.
## Chapter Two: The Secret of Hitting 

The application of pickleball skills is about to hit the ball. There are three hit techniques: the first is "direct hit," the second is "spin," and the third is "flicking." The direct hit breaks the opponent with straight force; spin confuses the opponent with variations; flicking controls the opponent with high and low, with unpredicted placement. Each technique has its strengths, complementing each other. Players should use them flexibly according to the opponent's situation.
  
## Chapter Three: The Precision of Hand Techniques

Hand techniques are the essence of pickleball. The three main techniques are: swinging, volleying, and blocking. Each technique has its unique uses, complementing each other. Swinging is the foundation, volleying is sharp, and blocking is stable. The techniques are diverse and ever-changing. Learners should carefully experience, practice diligently, and achieve the unity of mind and hand.  
  
## Chapter Four: The Variations of Footwork

Footwork is the foundation of defense and attack, moving like a wandering dragon and turning like a returning swallow. Footwork can be short or long, fast or slow. Practitioners should focus on stability and avoid impatience. Short steps are suitable for quick battles, long steps are beneficial for maneuvering. Step by step, one can respond to endless situations. The feet move with the body, allowing for smooth and effortless movement.
  
## Chapter Five: The Subtlety of Mental Techniques

A pickleball battle is not merely about temporary victory or defeat but a contest of mind and strategy. Mental techniques have three realms: the first is "defense like a mountain," with a steady and unwavering mind; the second is "attack like fire," with an aggressive and fiery offense; the third is "change like the wind," with unpredictable variations. Practitioners of mental techniques should cultivate introspection, respond calmly, observe the opponent's stance, and adapt accordingly.
  
## Chapter Six: The Skill of Body Techniques

Body techniques are the core application. They should be flexible and varied, with free and easy actions, using less movement to let the opponent move. There are three essentials: stance, movement, and turning. The stance should be stable, ready to move at any moment; movement should be agile, with strength contained within, flowing like clouds and water, unimpeded; turning should be balanced, with one foot as the pivot and the other moving, changing direction without increase or decrease.
  
## Chapter Seven: The Way of Intelligent Battle

Intelligent battle lies in knowing oneself and the opponent. Observe the opponent's weaknesses and formulate strategies; understand the situation on the court and choose techniques flexibly. Balancing skill and wisdom is essential for victory. Beyond intelligent battle, it is necessary to use principles to govern techniques, control movement with stillness, and maintain a calm heart, to see the vast freedom of the world.
