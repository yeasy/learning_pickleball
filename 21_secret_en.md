## Source of Power
The art of pickleball begins with the generation of power. Power starts from the feet, moving upwards through the legs, hips, waist, back, shoulders, arms, palms, and finally the fingers. The root of power lies in breath, following the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation. The transmission of power flows like a river, smooth when unblocked, penetrating when relaxed. To generate power, be like a drawn bow ready to release, tense internally but relaxed externally. At the moment of striking, it should be like waves crashing on rocks, or thunderbolts.

## Secrets of Hitting
The essence of pickleball lies in hitting the ball. There are three main techniques: "straight hit," "slice," and "lob." A straight hit uses direct force to break through; a slice uses variation to confuse the opponent; a lob controls the opponent with high and low drops. These techniques are complementary and should be applied flexibly according to the opponent's situation.

## Precision of Hand Techniques
Hand techniques are the essence of pickleball. The three main techniques are swing, volley, and push block, each with unique applications, working in harmony. Swinging is foundational, volleying is sharp, and pushing is steady. The palm is the root, the fingers the tool, winning with less and defeating the clumsy with cleverness. Move forward by moving backward, go left by going right. Techniques are varied and limitless. Learners should carefully understand and practice until achieving unity of mind and hand.

## Variations of Footwork
Footwork is the foundation of offense and defense, moving like a dragon, turning like a swift bird. Footwork can be short or long, fast or slow. Practitioners should prioritize stability and avoid impatience. Short steps are good for quick action, long steps for maneuvering. Advancing step by step ensures versatility. Moving with the body ensures seamless execution.

## Flexibility of Body Movement
Body movement is the core of technique. It must be flexible and versatile, effortlessly transitioning between stillness and motion, controlling the opponent. Body movement includes stance, movement, and turning. The stance must be stable, seemingly immobile but ready to move; movement must be lively, with power centered, flowing like clouds and water; turning must be balanced, with one foot as the axis and the other moving, changing direction without excess.

## Subtlety of Mind
The contest in pickleball is not merely about winning or losing, but a battle of wits and strategy. The mind has three states: "calm as a mountain," with a stable and unwavering heart; "advance like fire," with a relentless and fierce attack; "change like wind," with unpredictable variations. Practitioners should cultivate inner observation, honing their mind to reach a state of perfection.

## The Way to Victory
The way to victory lies in knowing yourself and your opponent. Identify the opponent's weaknesses, plan before acting, observe their stance, and adapt accordingly. Combining skill and intelligence leads to invincibility. Beyond techniques, one must govern the heart with the way, merging mind and method to achieve a harmonious state.
