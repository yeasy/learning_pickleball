# Frequent Questions and Answers

## [Q1] Can you share how to handle lob? Yesterday was terribly lost to it, I dare not go to the net after hitting the back

**Answer**: Lift the ball to the backcourt (lob) is challenging for amateur players to handle.

The first key is the footwork. When the quality of the opponent's lob is not high, go back as soon as possible to try to volley it, which will restrict the opponents to use lob easily.

If the opponent lobs the ball with high quality and difficult to volley, run to the side and behind of the ball in time and wait for the ball to bounce from the ground and then hit it. When the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, he tends to wait near the net to volley. In this case, the first choice for returning the ball is to drop, or lob to the opponent's space. Do not drive the ball directly.

Finally, when dinking in front of the net, pay attention to the quality and try to place the ball with an angle and not let the opponent return the ball very comfortably, so it will be difficult for the opponent to create a high-quality lob to you.

## [Q2] In doubles, a teammate hits the third shot and returns the ball. Should I run forward or wait in the backcourt at this time?

**Answer**: There is no fixed answer to this question, it depends on the quality of your teammate's third shot.

If the quality of the teammate's third shot is very high, such as the Drop is very short and low, then you both should go to the net in time; on the contrary, if the teammate's third shot gives a higher and longer net ball, then don't rush forward.

Usually, you can try to take a step forward from the backcourt, while observing the quality of the ball returned by your teammates and adjust the movement accordingly.

## [Q3] I always feel that I have used a lot of strength, but the ball is still not fast.

**Answer**: A very typical question.

It is often seen that amateur players are very strong, and hit the ball with a big movements and force, but the speed of the ball is not fast.

The key here is "effective power", that is, how much of the power from the body is transmitted to the ball. Human body strength comes from muscle contraction, and the direction of power transmission is determined by joints. If the muscles are constantly tense, dynamic force can no longer be generated; if the joints are constantly retracted, the transmission of force is hindered.

Therefore, in order to generate effective force, the muscles must be tightened from loosened, and the joints must be loosened first and then tightened. Of course, it requires a lot of scientific training to allow the body to become familiar with this process in a natural way.

## [Q4] Some people don't run too much, but they can move the opponents to run around. What's going on?

**Answer**: It is often seen in the game that some athletes do not seem to move very much, but can always return the ball; Some others are always running with lots of turning around, but lose a lot.

In track and field competitions, everyone compares the time it takes to run the same distance, and the speed to compare at this time is absolute.

In ball games, athletes' "fast" and "slow" speeds are actually relative.

The first is to look at the distance of movement that needs to be done, that is, the distance the player needs to move to complete the shot. My absolute speed may be slower than yours, but I can predict your return path. I always reach the ball in front of the body to hit; and you always have to run a few steps to catch the ball, even if you move fast, it looks too slow.

The second is to look at the completion time, that is, how long the player can complete the stroke. Good players will always hit the ball when it's high, but the top players can sometimes wait for the ball to come down and hit the ball at the end of the shot, often with multiple possible paths to choose. This means that opponents cannot predict in advance, and there is much less time to reflect and move.

Lastly is the acceleration. Top athletes can control the tempo of the game. When you just get used to his "slow" batting rhythm, he can suddenly accelerate, and if you can't keep up, he will naturally feel faster.

To sum up, the most important thing is to be able to control the opponent's return path and the rhythm of the game, and these require solid basic skills and excellent physical quality.

## [Q5] It is often heard that pickleball has some characteristics of tennis, badminton and table tennis. What are them?

**Answer**: Sports are essentially similar with each other. Ball games are all about power (both explosive and stamina), speed, spin and placement. However, different sports differ in form and focus.

Tennis has the highest requirements for strength, just like the broadsword, emphasizing wide opening and closing, and beating the opponents like breaking a bamboo; badminton has the highest requirements for speed and placement control, just like swordsmanship, pays attention to agility and elegance, and strikes back; table tennis has not only speed, but also the quickest rotation. Like a dagger, its shot is often unexpected and unpredictable; while the pickleball is like a nunchaku, both soft and firm, with both the drive and spin from tennis, the smash, drop, lob and footwork from badminton, and the push, block and dink from table tennis. 

## [Q6] What are the differences between amateur players and professional players?

**Answer**: The first is consistency. For the same drop shot, an amateur player may make one mistake every ten times, while a professional player may make one mistake every one hundred times. Overall, the unforced error rate of amateur players is much higher.

Second is the speed. When the pace of the game is slow, amateurs and professional players seem to perform similar; but when the pace increases, amateurs often can't keep up, and turnovers increase.

Another is the gaming consciousness. How to deal with the opponent's ball? Should I return a long ball or a short ball? Fast ball or slow ball? Where should I run after returning the ball? What is the other party's next intention? Amateur players usually don't think about these during the playing, while for professional players, these are often natural ideas, and they will choose the most favorable strategy for their own team and the most uncomfortable for the opponents.

## [Q7] How do I choose a paddle?
**Answer**: The combined length and width of a pickleball paddle cannot exceed 24 inches (60.96 cm), of which the length cannot exceed 17 inches (43.18 cm). There is no limit to the thickness and weight of the paddle.

In general, the following parameters can be considered when choosing a paddle:

* **Sweet spot**: The larger the sweet spot, the better the fault tolerance, but it often means that the paddle surface is larger, and the swing is slower. The ratio of the sweet spot to the paddle surface is an important indicator to the paddle’s technical quality. Beginners are recommended to choose a paddle with a higher proportion of the sweet spot.
* **Weight**: The heavier the paddle, the more it can avoid the vibration caused by hitting the ball, but the swing will be harder, which requires a better power. For beginners, it is recommended to consider paddles up to 8 oz (227 g) unless you have an excellent strength.
* **Center of mass**: The more forward the center of mass is, the more powerful the shot is, but it will be harder to control the paddle, which requires better hand sensitivity and higher power. Beginners are advised to consider a moderate paddle.
* **Handle length**: A longer handle usually means a larger hitting range, but it is more difficult to adjust the paddle, which requires better hand sensitivity and higher power. Beginners are advised to choose a handle with a moderate length.
* Handle thickness: Thicker handle is easier to exert force, but it is inconvenient to adjust the holding. For beginners, unless you have large hands, it is recommended to choose a thinner handle.
* **Paddle surface** thickness: The thicker the paddle surface, the better the vibration absorption when hitting the ball, but it will cause the ball speed to drop slightly. Beginners are advised to consider a paddle with a thickness of at least 14 mm.
* **Paddle surface roughness**: The rougher the paddle surface, the easier it is to create spin, but in turn, the more likely it is affected by the ball’s rotation. Beginners are advised to consider a paddle surface that does not have too much friction.
