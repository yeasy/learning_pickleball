# Frequent Questions and Answers

## [Q1] Can you share how to handle lob? Yesterday was terribly lost to it, I dare not go to the net after hitting the back

**Answer**: Lift the ball to the backcourt (lob) is challenging for amateur players to handle.

The first key is the footwork. When the quality of the opponent's lob is not high, go back as soon as possible to try to volley it.

If the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, run to the side and behind of the ball in time and wait for the ball to hit the ground and then hit it. When the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, he tends to wait near the net to volley. In this case, the first choice for returning the ball is to drop, or lob to the opponent's space. Do not drive the ball directly.

Finally, when dinking in front of the net, try to place the ball with an angle and not let the opponent return the ball very comfortably, so it will be difficult for the opponent to create a high-quality lob to you.

## [Q2] In doubles, a teammate hits the third shot and returns the ball. Should I run forward or wait in the backcourt at this time?

**Answer**: There is no fixed answer to this question, it depends on the quality of your teammate's third shot.

If the quality of the teammate's third shot is very high, such as the Drop is very short and low, then you boldly go to the net; on the contrary, if the teammate's third shot gives a higher and longer net ball, then don't rush forward.

Usually, you can try to take a step forward from the backcourt, while observing the quality of the ball returned by your teammates and adjust the movement accordingly.

## [Q3] I always feel that I have used a lot of strength, but the ball is still not fast.

**Answer**: A very typical question.

It is often seen that amateur players are very strong, and hit the ball with a big movements and force, but the speed of the ball is not fast.

The key here is "effective power", that is, how much of the power from the body is transmitted to the ball. Human body strength comes from muscle contraction, and the direction of power transmission is determined by joints. If the muscles are constantly tense, dynamic force can no longer be generated; if the joints are constantly retracted, the transmission of force is hindered.

Therefore, in order to generate effective force, the muscles must be tightened from loosened, and the joints must be loosened first and then tightened. Of course, training the body to become familiar with this process in a natural way requires scientific training.

## [Q4] Some people don't run too much, but they can move the opponents to run around. What's going on?

**Answer**: It is often seen in the game that some athletes do not seem to move very much, but can always return the ball; Some others are always running with lots of turning around, but lose a lot.

In track and field competitions, everyone compares the time it takes to run the same distance, and the speed to compare at this time is absolute.

In ball games, athletes' "fast" and "slow" speeds are actually relative.

The first is to look at the distance of movement that needs to be done, that is, the distance the player needs to move to complete the shot. My absolute speed may be slower than yours, but I can predict your return path. I always reach the ball in front of the body to hit; and you always have to run a few steps to catch the ball, even if you move fast, it looks too slow.

The second is to look at the completion time, that is, how long the player can complete the stroke. Good players will always hit the ball when it's high, but the top players can sometimes wait for the ball to come down and hit the ball at the end of the shot, often with multiple possible paths to choose. This means that opponents cannot predict in advance, and there is much less time to reflect and move.

Lastly is the acceleration. Top athletes can control the tempo of the game. When you just get used to his "slow" batting rhythm, he can suddenly accelerate, and if you can't keep up, he will naturally feel faster.

To sum up, the most important thing is to be able to control the opponent's return path and the rhythm of the game, and these require solid basic skills and excellent physical quality.
