## [Q1] Can you share how to handle lob? Yesterday was terribly lost to it, I dare not go to the net after hitting the back

**Answer**: Lift the ball to the backcourt (lob) is challenging for amateur players to handle.

The first key is the footwork. When the quality of the opponent's lob is not high, go back as soon as possible to try to volley it.

If the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, run to the side and behind of the ball in time and wait for the ball to hit the ground and then hit it. When the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, he tends to wait near the net to volley. In this case, the first choice for returning the ball is to drop, or lob to the opponent's space. Do not drive the ball directly.

Finally, when dinking in front of the net, try to place the ball with an angle and not let the opponent return the ball very comfortably, so it will be difficult for the opponent to create a high-quality lob to you.

## [Q2] In doubles, a teammate hits the third shot and returns the ball. Should I run forward or wait in the backcourt at this time? There seems to be a different decision.

**Answer**: There is no fixed answer to this question, it depends on the quality of your teammate's third shot.

If the quality of the teammate's third shot is very high, such as the Drop is very short and low, then you boldly go to the net; on the contrary, if the teammate's third shot gives a higher and longer net ball, then don't rush forward.

Usually, you can try to take a step forward from the backcourt, while observing the quality of the ball returned by your teammates and adjust the movement accordingly.

## [Q3] I always feel that I have used a lot of strength, but the ball is still not fast.

**Answer**: A very typical question.

It is often seen that amateur players are very strong, and hit the ball with a big movements and force, but the speed of the ball is not fast.

The key here is "effective power", that is, how much of the power from the body is transmitted to the ball. Human body strength comes from muscle contraction, and the direction of power transmission is determined by joints. If the muscles are constantly tense, dynamic force can no longer be generated; if the joints are constantly retracted, the transmission of force is hindered.

Therefore, in order to generate effective force, the muscles must be tightened from loosened, and the joints must be loosened first and then tightened. Of course, training the body to become familiar with this process in a natural way requires scientific training.
