It is said that several inventors of the Pickleball are keen on playing tennis and badminton, but due to the high threshold, they cannot enjoy sports with their families. So they decided to create a sport for all ages. Through comprehensive research on tennis, badminton, table tennis and other items, the three inventors selected a moderate field size, used wooden rackets, and manufactured slow-flying plastic balls, which greatly reduced the threshold for sports. Once the sport was launched, it became popular and spread rapidly. Pickleball got its name from the local rowing event "Pickle Boat".

Till the year 1990, all 50 states in USA have pickleball players. In 2010, International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was founded to help promote the sport around the world.
 
To commemorate the invention of the pickleball, the World Pickleball Championship since 2017 named its trophy the "Bainbridge Cup". It has been held successively in Spain, Italy, Germany, the United States, India and other countries.

## Ball and Paddle

A pickleball ball is a hard plastic ball, slightly larger than a tennis ball, and is usually colored like yellow or orange. There are 26 to 40 circular holes with a diameter of around 1 cm on the spherical surface (there are differences between indoor and outdoor balls, the softer and lighter indoor ball has 26 holes, the hole diameter is larger and fly more slowly). The rotation of the ball is not too violent, and at the same time the elasticity is not great, making it fly relatively slowly in the air.

The paddle of the Pickleball is like a large table tennis paddle without rubber, the sum of whose length and width cannot exceed 24 inches, where the length cannot exceed 17 inches. Usually the paddle has a length of 15.5 ~ 17 inches (39.37 ~ 43.18 cm) and a width of 7 ~ 8.25 inches (17.78 ~ 20.96 cm), and the handler length is 4~5.5 inches. At first, the rackets were mostly made of wood, but later they were also made of new materials such as glass fiber and carbon fiber. The racket is not very elastic and has a relatively smooth surface. Pickleball is very easy to play, but it takes a certain amount of time and energy to learn skills, improve physical fitness and master appropriate strategies to play well.

## Basic Rules

The pickleball field measures 44x20 feet and the net is 34 inches high in the middle and 36 inches high on the side. At least 10 feet (approximately 3 meters) of distance should remain after the baseline, and at least 5 feet of distance should be keep from the sideline. For indoor courts, there must be at least 20 feet (approximately 6.1 meters) height from the ceiling.

The ground area within 7 feet (approximately 2.13 meters) on both sides of the net is called the "Non-Volley Zone (NVZ)" or "Kitchen (Kitchen)". Before, during and after the volley, no part of the player's body (including the paddle and accessories) may touch the Non-Volley Zone.

A pickleball court is the same size as a badminton court. Therefore, it is very convenient to raise the net to play badminton and lower it to play pickleball in the same field.

Pickleball scoring is similar to badminton, but only the serving team can score points during their round.

Taking doubles as an example, each game has 11 points, and each player on the serving side has one chance to serve (In total two chances for each side). After serving, the opponent receives the serve and returns, and the serving party hits the ball to the opposite side. From the fourth shot,  players can either hit groundstroke or volley the ball that has not landed. If the serving team scores in this round, then switch sides with teammates and continue serving, otherwise the teammate will continue to serve. Only serving team can score points if they win the round, and the receiving team will not get points even win.

## Pickleball Features

Pickleball combines elements of badminton, table tennis and tennis and is a comprehensive sport.
