# Background Knowledge

Pickleball, as an emerging sport born in the 1960s, has swept North America and attracted more and more interests among people worldwide.

Pickleball combines the skills of tennis, badminton, table tennis and other sports. It is fun to play, easy to learn, and moderate in intensity, and it is not easy to be injured. It can be described as suitable for all ages. Anyone in their 70s or 80s, or children in their teens, can participate.

## Origin of Pickleball

In the summer of 1965, the pickleball was invented by Congressman Joel Pritchard (1925 ~ 1997) and his friends Bill Bell (1923 ~ 2006) and Barney McCallum (1926 ~ 2019) while vacationing on Bainbridge Island in Seattle, USA.

It is said that they both like to play tennis and badminton, but because of the high learning difficulty, their families can not join easily. So, they wanted to invent a sport that the seniors and youths can also participate in. After a comprehensive study of tennis, badminton, table tennis and other sports, the three inventors chose a moderate court size, used a wooden paddle, and designed a slow-flying plastic ball, which greatly lowered the learning bar for getting started. Everyone fell in love with the new sport all at once, and it spread soon. The name of Pickleball came from a local “pickle boat” races.

Till the year 1990, all 50 states in USA have pickleball players. In 2010, International Federation of Pickleball (IFP) was founded to help promote the sport around the world.
 
To commemorate the invention of the pickleball, the World Pickleball Championship since 2017 named its trophy the "Bainbridge Cup". The first three championships were won by its country of origin, the United States.

## Ball and Paddle

Pickleballs are slightly larger than tennis balls, which are made of hard plastic and are usually yellow or orange, and there are 26 to 40 holes with a diameter of less than 1cm (The indoor balls are slightly softer and have fewer holes). The balls usually do not rotate fast or bounce high.

The paddle of the Pickleball is like a large table tennis paddle without rubber, with a length of 15.5 ~ 17 inches (39.37 ~ 43.18 cm) and a width of 7 ~ 8.25 inches (17.78 ~ 20.96 cm). It was originally made of wood, and later glass fiber and carbon fiber were used, and other new materials too. The paddle has little elasticity and a smooth surface. Pickleball is easy to start, but getting advanced requires lots of skills, strength and strategies.

## Basic Rules

The court size is 44x20 feet (about 13.4x6.1 meters), and the net height is 34 inches and 36 inches at the center and side (about 88.36 cm and 91.44 cm), which is the same size as the badminton court. Therefore, it is very convenient to raise the net to play badminton and lower it to play pickleball on the same field.

Pickleball scoring is similar to badminton, but only the serving team can score points during their round.

Taking doubles as an example, each game has 11 points, and each player on the serving side has one chance to serve (In total two chances for each side). After serving, the opponent receives the serve and returns, and the serving party hits the ball to the opposite side. From the fourth shot,  players can either hit groundstroke or volley the ball that has not landed. If the serving team scores in this round, then switch sides with teammates and continue serving, otherwise the teammate will continue to serve. Only serving team can score points if they win the round, and the receiving team will not get points even win.

In addition, the area near the net is called the "Non-Volley Zone (NVZ)" or "Kitchen". Competitors are not allowed to step into this area before and after a volley.

## Pickleball Features

Pickleball incorporates the elements of badminton, table tennis and tennis. A group of four players in a regular double game are playing in a not very large court, making it easier to run and play.

Pickleball is quick to start, easy to control, moderate to run (not as high as tennis and badminton for jumping and running), etc. The reasons include: a) the court of pickleball is not large (smaller than tennis court); b) the weight of pickleball is relatively light (only more than 20 grams) and the ball does not bounce a lot; c) the paddle is light in weight and has a large hitting area. Therefore, pickleballs can be played in singles or doubles, indoor and outdoor venues, and are loved by people of different ages.

The overall amount of activity in pickleball is moderate, but it has rich skills. In addition to drive, smash, drop, and slices, there are also volleys and lobs. The competition between the two sides is not only about strength or speed, but also about the control of the ball (which is often more important). In doubles, teamwork is especially critical. In pickleball games, one rally can last to tens of hits, which is quite entertaining.

## Status and Future

According to the USA Pickleball Association (USAPA), there are currently more than 5 million pickleball players in the United States (In comparison, tennis players are less than 20 million, badminton players are less than 1.5 million, and pingpong players are less than 1 million), and the number is growing at a rate of more than 20% per year. The Professional Pickleball Association (PPA) and Association of Pickleball Professionals (APP) hold 20 and 30 tournaments every year. The players in professional tournaments are usually with age between 14 years and 35 years.

In addition to North America, the pickleball has also become very popular in Europe. Asian regions including China, Japan, India, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, have also begun to popularize and hold big tournaments. As of the end of 2022, over 60 countries around the world have joined the International Federation of Pickleball, hosting 12 international competitions. It is believed that in the near future, the Pickleball will become an official event in the Olympic Games and other international events.

In addition, more and more schools have made it a physical education program, with more than 500 schools in New York State alone. In other countries, more and more schools are setting it up as a new course.
