# Frequent Questions and Answers

## [Q1] Can you share how to handle lob?

**Answer**: Lob (Lifting the ball to the backcourt) is very challenging for amateur players to handle.

The first key factor is the footwork. When the opponent's lob is not high and far enough, retreat as quickly as possible and jump to volley it, which will restrict the opponents to use lob again.

If the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, it will be difficult to volley directly. Run to the ahead of the ball's landing position in time and wait for the ball to bounce from the ground and then hit it. When the opponent lobs the ball with high quality, he tends to wait near the net to volley. In this case, the first choice for returning the ball is to drop, or lob to the opponent's back. Do not drive the ball directly, which is expecting by the opponents in most cases.

Finally, when dinking in front of the net, pay attention to the quality and try to place the ball with a wide angle and do not let the opponent return the ball very comfortably, so the opponent cannot make a high-quality lob easily.

## [Q2] When the teammate hits the third shot in doubles, should I run forward or wait in the backcourt?

**Answer**: There is no fixed answer to this question, it depends on the quality of your teammate's third shot.

If the quality of the teammate's third shot is very high, i.e., a very short and low Drop, or a very fast and low Drive, then you both should go to the net in time. Especially when the opponent’s return is high, you should prepare to poach the ball; on the contrary, if the teammate's third shot is too high or too long , then don't rush forward.

Usually, you can try to take a step forward from the backcourt, while observing the quality of the shot by your teammates and adjust the movement accordingly.

## [Q3] I have used a lot of strength, but my shot is still not fast.

**Answer**: A very typical question.

It is quite popular to see that a very strong amateur player hits the ball with a big movements, but the returned ball is still not fast. But some professional player can hit a very quick ball with a small action.

The reason here is the "effective force", that is, how much of the power from the body is transmitted to the ball. 

Human body strength comes from muscle contraction from relax status, and the direction of power transmission is determined by joints. If the muscles are constantly tense or relax, force can no longer be generated; if the joints are constantly under stress, the transmission of force is hindered.

Therefore, in order to generate effective force, the muscles must be tightened quickly from loosened, and the joints must be loosened first and then tightened. Of course, it requires a lot of scientific training to allow the body to become familiar with this process in a natural way.

## [Q4] Some players don't run too much, but they can move the opponents to run around. Why?

**Answer**: It is often seen in the tournaments that some athletes do not seem to move very much, but can always return the ball comfortably; Some others are always running with lots of turning around, but lose a lot.

In track and field competitions, everyone compares the speed by counting the time it takes to finish the same distance, which is the absolute speed.

In ball games, athletes' "fast" and "slow" speeds are relative instead.

First, look at the needed distance of movement, that is, the distance the player needs to move to do the shot. My absolute speed may be slower than yours, but I can predict and restrict your return path. In this case, I always hit the ball in front of the body; and you always have to run a few steps to catch the ball, then even if you move faster than me, it looks too slow.

Second, look at the completion time, i.e., how long the player can complete the stroke. Good players can hit the ball when it's high, but the top players can sometimes wait for the ball to drop down and hit the ball at the end of the shot, and often with multiple possible paths to choose. This means that opponents cannot predict in advance, and there is much less time to reflect and move.

Lastly is the acceleration. Top athletes can control the tempo of the game. When you just get used to his "slow" batting rhythm, he can suddenly accelerate, and if you can't keep up, he will naturally feel faster.

To sum up, the most important thing is to be able to control the opponent's return path and the rhythm of the game, and these require solid skills and excellent physical quality.

## [Q5] It is often heard that pickleball has some features of tennis, badminton and table tennis. What are them?

**Answer**: Sports are essentially similar with each other. Ball games are all about power (both explosive and stamina), speed, spin and placement. However, different sports differ in form and focus.

Tennis has the highest requirements for strength, just like the broadsword, emphasizing wide opening and closing, and beating the opponents like breaking a bamboo; badminton has the highest requirements for speed and placement control, just like swordsmanship, pays attention to agility and elegance, and strikes back; table tennis has not only speed, but also the quickest rotation. Like a dagger, its shot is often unexpected and unpredictable; while the pickleball is like a nunchaku, both soft and firm, with both the drive and spin from tennis, the smash, drop, lob and footwork from badminton, and the push, block and dink from table tennis. 

## [Q6] What are the key differences between amateur players and professional players?

**Answer**: There are several key differences.

The first is **consistency**. Professional players can control the ball more stably. For the same drop shot, an amateur player may make one mistake every ten times, while a professional player may make one mistake every one hundred times. Overall, the unforced error rate of amateur players is much higher.

Second is the **speed**. When the pace of the game is slow, amateurs and professional players seem to perform similar; but when the pace increases, amateurs often can't keep up, and turnovers increase.

Another is the **gaming consciousness**. How to deal with the opponent's ball? Should I return a long ball or a short ball? Speed up or slow down? Where should I run after returning the ball? What is the other party's next intention? Amateur players usually don't think about these during the playing, while for professional players, these are as natural as breath. They will always choose the most favorable strategy for their own team and the most uncomfortable for the opponents.

## [Q7] How to choose a suitable paddle?
**Answer**: According to the rules, the combined length and width of a pickleball paddle cannot exceed 24 inches (60.96 cm), of which the length cannot exceed 17 inches (43.18 cm). There is no limit to the thickness and weight of the paddle, but the common thickness range is 10 ~ 16 mm, and weight range is 7 ~ 9 oz.

In general, no paddle fits everyone. The following parameters can be considered based on your level:

* **Weight**: The heavier the paddle, the more it can avoid the vibration caused by hitting the ball, but the swing will be harder, which requires a better power. For beginners, it is recommended to consider paddles up to 8 oz (227 g) unless you have an excellent strength.
* **Center of Mass**: The more forward the center of mass is, the more powerful the shot is, but it will be harder to control the paddle, which requires better hand sensitivity and higher power. Beginners are advised to consider a moderate paddle.
* **Handle Length**: A longer handle usually means a larger hitting range, but it is more difficult to adjust the paddle, which requires better hand sensitivity and higher power. Beginners are advised to choose a handle with a moderate length.
* **Handle Thickness**: A thicker handle handle is easier to exert force, but it is inconvenient to adjust the holding. For beginners, unless you have large hands, it is recommended to choose a thinner handle.
* **Face Size**: The larger the face, usually the larger the sweet spot, and the better the fault tolerance, but it often means that the swing is slower. The ratio of the sweet spot to the paddle face is an important indicator to the paddle’s technical quality. Beginners are recommended to choose a paddle with a large face.
* **Face Thickness**: The thicker the paddle face, the better the vibration absorption when hitting the ball, and the sweet spot is often larger. Beginners are advised to consider a paddle with a thickness of at least 14 mm.
* **Surface Roughness**: The rougher the paddle surface, the easier it is to create spin, but in turn, the more likely it is affected by the ball’s rotation. Beginners are advised to consider a paddle surface that does not have too much friction.

In addition, the modern paddle body is mostly a honeycomb structure constructed of polymers, including Polypropylene (soft and flexible) and Nomex (rigid nylon, harder). In the early days, there were also materials such as wood or aluminum. Surface materials include fiberglass (soft, smaller sweet spot), graphite fiber, carbon fiber (hard, larger sweet spot), etc. At present, mainstream paddle mostly use polymers as the body and carbon fiber surfaces.

## [Q8] How to deal with the ball between two players in doubles?

**Answer**: In double games, there are often situations where two players rush to hit the ball in the middle position together, or let the other side deal with it, resulting in loss of points.

The handling of the middle-position ball requires players to negotiate the principles in advance. Generally speaking, here are some common principles:

* Let **forehand position player** handle: The power and angle of the forehand shots tend to be better;
* Let **higher level player** handle: Higher level player usually has better stability and force;
* Let **male player** handle (in mixed double games): Male player is usually better in strength and speed, and is usually responsible for 2/3 or more of the courts in mixed doubles.

## [Q9] I play pickleball 3 hours a day, why my skill does not improve a lot?
**Answer**: The problem that amateur players often encounter is that they play every day, but their skills don't improve, and sometimes they even go backwards.

This situation may be mainly due to the following reasons.

The first is the **lack of effective training**. It seems to be playing every day, but there is very little time for scientific training, and even the wrong movements and skills are constantly repeated, resulting in stagnation of the level. Once bad habits are established, it will be difficult to correct.

The second is the **lack of systematic training**. When players are at different levels, the focus of training is different. For example, basic skills should be emphasized at the beginner level, strategies should be mastered at the intermediate level, and rhythm should be learned to control at the advanced level. In addition, different players have different characteristics and weaknesses. If the training is not systematic, it often seems that you practice hard, but in fact, you will get half the result with twice the effort.

In addition, the **intensity of training is not properly arranged**. The essence of efficiency is to alternate training with rest properly. Excessive training may result in decreased physical fitness and even lead to injury. Therefore, scientific training and physical strengthening, relaxation and recovery outside of training are very important.

Finally, the **lack of training the IQ of playing**. Practicing hard may build up a good strength and solid skills, but when to use what tricks, when to speed up, and when to slow down, these are the places for your IQ of playing. In addition to training, strengthening theoretical study must be taken to achieve a comprehensive improvement.
