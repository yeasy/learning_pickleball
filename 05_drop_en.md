# How to Drop

Drop technology is the core technology in the doubles event of the pickleball. If you don't master the drop technique, you can't progress to a higher level.

## What is Drop

Putting the drop refers to the action of placing the ball in the opponent's NVZ area in the middle and backcourt (as close as possible to the front half), and at the same time running to the frontcourt or in front of the net before the opponent returns the ball.

It can be simply understood that putting a tennis ball is the Dink ball of the far net.

Similarly, tennis balls can also be divided into three types: straight balls, diagonal balls and intermediate balls:

* Straight ball: The straight ball has a shorter trajectory and is usually easier to control, but is prone to a higher or farther trajectory. At the same time, the ball lands earlier, and the time spent online is shorter;
* Cross-court Ball: A cross-court Ball is when the ball is dropped into the opposing opponent's area. The distance is longer, the ball lands later, and you have more time to go to the net.
* Middle ball: The middle ball refers to placing the ball in the space between the two opponents. Since both of them can catch the ball, it will cause some trouble to judge in time.

## When to use Drop

When your side is in the middle and backcourt and the other side is waiting in front of the net, at this time, you can let your side run to the front of the net by releasing the net to form a stalemate.

The main purpose of putting tennis balls is to let oneself run to the net quickly and form a stalemate with the opponent's net.

## How to master Drop

When drop the ball, avoid returning the ball too far and too high, so that the opponent can volley the ball.

First practice defensive Drop without spin, and then practice Drop with spin (mainly topspin), which has a certain degree of offensiveness.

* Fixed-position training: take a step back from the NVZ line, and do Drop training. After mastering it, take one more step back for training until you retreat to the backcourt line.
* Moving training: After mastering the fixed-position Drop training, you can carry out the Drop training while moving. The sparring player hits the ball to the backcourt, and you Drop the ball and follow the ball to run to the net to form a stalemate.
