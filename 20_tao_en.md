# The Tao of Pickleball

## The Path to Victory
**Beginner**: How can I defeat an opponent stronger than me?
**Master**: Let them play to their full potential.

**Beginner**: But if they play their best, surely I will lose?
**Master**: No. Let them over-play. Let them seek the winner too early. Let them make the mistake.

The beginner bowed in understanding.

## Equipment
**Beginner**: Why is the club champion playing with a cheap, beaten-up paddle?
**Master**: He has grasped the essence. He plays with the paddle; he does not rely on the paddle to play for him.

## Perception
**Beginner**: I practice hard, but I lose in tournaments. Why?
**Master**: A goldfish in a bowl cannot imagine the currents of the ocean. You practice in comfort; competition is chaos. Embrace the chaos.

## The Wrong Path
**Beginner**: They called me a prodigy after three months. Why am I not a master after a year?
**Master**: The prodigy relies on talent and skips the foundation. When the foundation crumbles, it is often too late to rebuild.

## Fame
**Beginner**: I have won many medals, yet I lost to an old man nobody knows.
**Master**: The true master seeks understanding, not applause. The medal gathers dust; the skill remains.

## The Ultimate Technique
**Beginner**: What is the invincible shot?
**Master**: The one that is not returned. It need not be fast, nor fancy. It simply must land.

## Source of Power
**Beginner**: How do I hit with power?
**Master**: With the earth. Push from your legs.
**Beginner**: How do I hit with speed?
**Master**: With your body. Rotate your core.
**Beginner**: How do I hit with deception?
**Master**: With your stillness.
**Beginner**: How do I hit the winner?
**Master**: With your mind. See the open space before you strike.

## Imitation
**Beginner**: I copy your form perfectly, yet I fail.
**Master**: You copy the shell, not the soul. Learn *why* I move, not just *how*.

## Cross-Training
**Beginner**: I am a table tennis expert. How do I improve?
**Master**: Learn tennis.
**Beginner**: Now I know tennis. How do I improve?
**Master**: Learn badminton.
**Beginner**: Now I know badminton. What next?
**Master**: Forget them all. Play pickleball.

## Art and Sport
**Beginner**: Is pickleball an art?
**Master**: It is like jazz. You must master the scales (drills) so that you can improvise (play) when the rhythm changes.

## The Impossible Triangle
**Beginner**: What is the impossible choice?
**Master**: Power, Speed, Control. You may often have two, but rarely all three. Choose wisely.

## Perspective
**Beginner**: Pro games look so easy. I could do that.
**Master**: Go play. Come back in a year.
*(A year passes)*
**Beginner**: It is impossibly complex! Every micro-movement is calculated.
**Master**: Good. Go play. Come back in a year.
*(A year passes)*
**Beginner**: It is actually quite simple. It flows naturally.
**Master**: Now you understand.

## Harmony
**Beginner**: How do I become one with the paddle?
**Master**: Let the paddle turn in your palm.
**Beginner**: But sometimes I don't have time to swing the paddle. What should I do?
**Master**: Let the body float on the court.
