* Obey the referee's judgment, and the receiver shall make the judgment in the absence of a referee;

## Terminologies

* Around the Post: ATP, the player hits the ball from outside of the court (left side or right side), and let the ball land into the opponent court around the net post (not above the net).
* Double-Bounce rule: The player serves the ball, the opponent must wait for the ball to bounce before returning the ball (first bounce), and the receiver must wait for the ball to bounce again before returning the ball (second bounce).
* Non-Volley Zone: NVZ, also known as the Kitchen. Refers to the area between the net and the first line. It is considered an violation if the athlete touches the area (including the line) before and after a volley.
