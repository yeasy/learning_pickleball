# How to Drive

The drive technique is the one of the most common techniques, especially in single games.

In the singles game, the opponent is often mobilized by driving the ball, and in the doubles game, the drive can be used to transit to the next shot.

A high-quality drive can even score directly.

## What is Drive

Drive is the action of hitting the ball quickly to make the ball flies forward fast.

It can be roughly divided into the far net Drive, the middle net Drive, and the near net Drive.

* Far-net Drive: The far-net Drive is similar to the action of serving a ball. By Driveing the ground and turning the waist, swinging the big arm, driving the forearm, and finally whipping the ball. The general target is the opponent's midfield.
* Midfield Drive: The near-net Drive is a transition by hitting when the opponent returns the ball to the midfield and it bounces high. The general target is the opposing near-net area or midfield.
* Close-net Drive: The close-net is to attack the ball by hitting the ball when the opponent's return is shorter and the ball bounces high. Care should be taken to control the running trajectory not to cross the net too high,

## When to use Drive

When the ball jumps high after landing, or the opponent does not form an effective net block, you can try to Drive the ball.

The main purpose of swiping the ball is to mobilize the opponent, or make the opponent return the ball in a hurry and the quality is not high, so as to form a chance for the next shot.

## How to master Drive

The most important thing in driving the ball is to hit the ball in front of you, and always hit the ball with a stable body. Another thing is to master the force of the whip, and release the whole body's force of turning the waist through the stable hitting surface formed by the clap hand.

It should be noted that the surface of the Pickleball and racket is relatively smooth. In most cases, the Drive should be based on hitting, supplemented by rotation. In addition, the ball should not be too high when it crosses the net. It is best to fall down quickly to limit the opponent's return route.

The backhand is basically symmetrical with the forehand. Try to shoot with one hand to get more distance to add power and a larger return angle.

In double games, the target of the Drive can generally be between two opposing players, or in a defensive space. When the opponent's defensive ability is weak, you can also deliberately play a close ball (such as holding a clapping shoulder, etc.), causing the opponent to make mistakes.

In single games, the Drive should mainly aim at the opponent's gap, and the gesture should be small, in order to prevent the opponent from predicting easily.

The Drive can be trained through the following steps:

* Multi-ball practice: The sparring staff throws the ball to the player, and the player hits the ball into the designated target area after landing and bouncing, and the ball should not go too high over the net. There should be no less than 50 consecutive draws each time, and no less than 10 sets of exercises should be performed every day. You can practice hitting the ball to different positions on the court.
* Returning practice: The sparring staff and players practice driving the ball together. First practice at fixed location, and then free practice. There should be no less than 50 consecutive draws each time, and no less than 10 sets of exercises should be performed every day.
