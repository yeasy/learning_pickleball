# How to Volley

Volley is the most common scoring method for pickleball.

## What is Volley

Volley refers to the action of hitting the ball during the flight of the ball after the opponent hits the ball and before the ball hits the ground. The volley is faster and the opponent is more difficult to handle.

Generally, according to the location of the volley, it can be divided into far net volley, midfield volley, and close net volley.

* Long net volley: High ball in the backcourt, you can also force the opponent to retreat into the backcourt by volleying.
* Midfield volley: The midfield volley is mostly when the opponent gives a long ball in the process of surfing the net. At this time, you should use gentle force, put the ball in front of the opponent's net instantly, and surf the net quickly at the same time.
* Near net volley: high ball in front of the net, you can hit the ball vigorously to make the ball fly quickly, causing the opponent to miss the ball. For non-high balls, avoid making vigorous efforts and focus on pushing, so that the ball does not go too high over the net. The net volley should avoid stepping into the NVZ area.

## When to use Volley

When the opponent returns the ball farther and higher, you can score by volleying.

## How to master Volley

The deadline must first be moved in place, and run to the forward direction of the ball in time by predicting the trajectory of the ball. The volley position should be earlier than the non-volley.

In addition, when volleying, the racket should be stable to avoid excessive friction of the ball and cause the ball to deviate from the trajectory.

The landing point of the volley should be far from the opponent's neutral position, and you can also choose to volley the opponent's ankle position. Generally, do not volley towards above the waist to avoid going out. Unless you are very confident, it is generally not recommended to hit the ball to the sideline, becausee it is easy to make mistakes and go out.

Volleys can be practiced through racket swings, with a set of 50, practice 10 sets per day.
