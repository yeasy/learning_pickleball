# How to Volley

Volley is the most common scoring method for pickleball, which is similar with the smash in badminton.

## What is Volley

Volley refers to the action of hitting the ball during the flight of the ball before the ball hits the ground. Usually, the volley is quicker in action and the opponent feels more difficult to handle it in a shorter time.

Generally, according to the location of the volley, it can be divided into far net volley, midfield volley, and close net volley.

* Long net volley: High ball in the backcourt, you can also force the opponent to retreat into the backcourt by volleying.
* Midfield volley: The midfield volley is mostly when the opponent gives a long ball in the process of surfing the net. At this time, you should use gentle force, put the ball in front of the opponent's net instantly, and surf the net quickly at the same time.
* Near net volley: For high ball in front of the net, you can hit the ball quickly in order to earn a point. For non-high balls, avoid making vigorous efforts. Usually push the ball to the backcourt, or hit the ball shortly to attack, so that the ball does not go too high over the net. Pay attention to avoid stepping into the NVZ area.

In particular, both sides of the game can volley opponent's volley ball directly, which will form a faster round rhythm.

## When to use Volley

When the opponent at back court returns the ball too far or too high to create a good attack opportunity, you can score by volleying.

When the opponent dinks near the net, and returns the ball too far or too high, you can volley to try attacking the opponents to create score opportunities.

## How to master Volley

First need to move to an approprite position. Move to the direction of the ball in time by predicting the trajectory of the ball. The volley position should be earlier than the non-volley position.

In addition, when volleying, the racket should be stable to avoid excessive friction of the ball, which can cause the ball to deviate from the target.

The landing point of the volley should be far from the opponent's neutral position, and you can also choose to volley the opponent's ankle position. Generally, do not volley towards above the waist to avoid going out. Unless you are very confident, it is generally not recommended to hit the ball to the sideline, becausee it is easy to make mistakes and go out. When the opponets are near the net, can attack the ball to the shoulder with the paddle, to cause a body attack.

When both sides volley each other near the net quickly, keep the arm steady and use small movements (wrist or fingers) to quickly exert the power.

You can master the volley technique through the following trainings:

* Practice volleys with swing paddle movements, 50 sets per set, 10 sets per day;
* Hit the wall with volley by 50 consecutive forehands, 50 consecutive backhands, 50 alternate forehands and backhands. Practice 10 sets a day.
* Ball feeding practice: the sparring player continuously sends out balls of different heights, and the trainer volleys to a given position.
* Return practice: both players continue to volley in the air so that the ball does not fall to the ground. The distance between the two sides can be adjusted.
