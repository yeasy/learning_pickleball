# Master Spin

Spin is an important charm of ball games. Reasonable adoption of spin can allow to control the ball’s flight path and landing position in a better way.

## Spin types

Different spins can cause different offset of the ball’s flight path. According to the direction of Spin, it can be divided into the following categories:

* **Topspin**: The ball rolls forward rapidly, causing the trajectory to fall sharply. The ball path is shorter than that of non-spinning balls, and will move forward quickly after bounce up;
* **Backspin**: The ball rolls back quickly, resulting in a flatter trajectory and a longer ball path than a non-spinning ball. The ball will move forward slowly after bounce, even move backward;
* **Sidespin**: Including left-spin or right-spin, the ball will deviate in the direction of Spin.

## When to Use Spin

Pickleball's spin is relatively weak (generally less than 20 revolutions per second, tennis can exceed 50 rps and Ping pong can exceed 100 rps), and because of the smooth paddle surface, spin plays a lesser role when hitting.

Consider using Spin in the following scenarios:

* Serve: Use spins to cause the opponent's prediction error on the ball's trajectory;
* Dink or Drop: Use spins to cause the opponent to hit the ball at a discomfortable position, forcing the return ball too high or too low;
* Drive or lob: Use topspin to avoid letting the ball go out;
* Volley: Use spins to cause the opponent to fail to return the ball;
* ATP: Use side spin to let the ball land into the court from outside.

Pay attention that when adding spin to the ball, because part of the energy turns into the rotation instead of flight speed, the ball usually flies slower than normal. Therefore, when you want to let the ball move very quickly, try to use as little spin as possible.

## How to Master Spin

The spin of a pickleball is hardly produced by only rubbing it using the paddle surface, but rather by hitting the different positions of the ball and pushing the ball around. Therefore, when using the spin to control the trajectory of the ball, it is important to focus on hitting the ball mainly, and cooperate with a following push. Remember to hit first then rotate the ball.

There are several ways to practice spin, and you need to feel the different spins caused by hitting different positions of the ball:

* Bounce the ball to create Spin: let the ball bounce on the paddle, and make different spins when cutting the ball in different directions;
* Serve to create Spin: hit different positions of the ball, send the ball with different spins, and observe the trajectory after it bounces from the ground;
* Return to create Spin: hit the coming ball at different positions, return the ball with different spins, and observe its flight trajectory.

## How to Handle Spinning Balls

To handle the spinning ball well, you must first understand the impact of different spins on the ball's flight path and behavior after landing, and move proactively to have a solid hit. For example, if the opponent hits a topspin ball, the return position should be more forward, and at the same time, the surface of the paddle should not be too high. Conversely, you can also consider taking the initiative to use the power of the opponent's topspin to hit the ball.

In addition, to weaken the effect of spin, the simplest principle is to hit the ball in the same way as the player that creates the spin. For example, try to hit the bottom of the ball to catch a back spinning ball, and hit the ball up to avoid drop down to the net. If you use the drive to return the backs spinning ball, the pushing up more sufficiently than returning a non-spinning ball.

Finally, you can hit the ball faster, to reduce the contact time between the ball and the paddle, which also reduces the impact of spin.
